window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Many fall as the last enchanter rises....</b></p> <p>The first line of the ancient prophecy keeps playing over and over in my head, but I’m afraid to remember the rest. I don’t want to think about what’s coming for us - what’s coming for <i>him</i>. I’ve been keeping Brinnswick safe for years; I’ve been keeping my coven safe my whole life; and now, I was responsible for keeping Sebastian safe, too. It shouldn’t have been a problem, he was my <i>vitmea viramore</i>, after all, and I was used to having the weight of the world on my shoulders.</p> <p>What Seb doesn’t know is that everyone in the magical community is after him - even if they don’t realize it yet. They’ve been looking for him for centuries; not only for him, but for his <i>soul</i>. But they never counted on him having me. I will protect him with my every breath and take down anyone that gets in our way. His soul belongs with me, not in the arms of evil.</p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Soul</i> is the second book in the Ellwood Chronicles and is a continuation of Sebastian and Ailin’s story. It contains explicit material and is intended for mature adults 18 years of age and older.</p> <p>Recommended Reading Order:</p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Flame</i></p> <p><i>The Witch’s Seal</i></p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Soul</i></p>";
