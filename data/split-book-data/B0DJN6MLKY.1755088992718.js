With his new ally Casey Chin by his side, he's got a real chance of building the Clan. The problem is, their alliance hinges on one factor: speed.</p> <p>Arthur and his Benevolent Durians must climb with Casey, as fast as possible to get her a speed run bonus. But the Tower remains as treacherous as ever, growing more dangerous with every step. The Durians will need to balance their ascent speed with their cultivation progress if they hope to succeed.</p> <p>Survival is no longer the only goal—it's a speed run to the top, and the stakes have never been higher.</p>";
