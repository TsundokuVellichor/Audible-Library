Ever since that fateful night, Max has devoted himself to the game far more than any mere fan, becoming not only a serious footballer in his own right but a leader both on and off the pitch.</p> <p>Then, just as he's about to accept a manager position at formerly bottom-of-the-league Telford, Max is offered the job of director of football at Chester FC, a role that may not even exist . . . yet. But in order to have a chance in hell of getting the gig, he's going to have to convince the team's fan representative board—one of whose members goes by the charming name \"Bulldog\"—that he's for real.</p> <p>To do that, Max will have to play attack <i>and</i> defence as he navigates the stark reality of the professional football industry and struggles to survive to play another day. Because while playing hard on the field can get you a win, playing hardball off the field can lose you everything.</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 800,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
