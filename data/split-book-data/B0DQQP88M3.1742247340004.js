window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Reality was objective—until they shattered it—in the first installment of this mind-bending fantasy series.</b></p> <p>In a world where thoughts shape reality, Vern watches as the laws of physics crumble around him. But while others embrace mysticism, this scientist sees an opportunity to reverse engineer the new rules governing Victorian Elmhurst.</p> <p>Marked by an elder god's rune burning in his mind and racing against its corruption, Vern forges his own way. Armed with years of scientific knowledge, he develops a unique power: the ability to perceive and manipulate Balance itself.</p> <p>As he navigates gothic streets and political intrigue, Vern uncovers terrible secrets: immortal societies vying for control, cultists wielding reality like a weapon, and cosmic horrors that jeopardize humanity's very understanding of existence. With each encounter threatening to shatter his mind, he realizes that in a universe gone mad, perhaps ascending to godhood is the only path to sanity.</p> <p><b>The first volume of this steampunk fantasy series—with almost a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
