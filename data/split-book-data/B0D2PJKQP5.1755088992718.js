window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Like many teenagers, there's a lot about Daniel Meadows' life that's out of his control. For example, having to start in a new school district for his freshman year of high school thanks to his dad's new job. Inside the realm of his control, however, is the decision to try a brand-new sport purely to impress a girl. </p> <p>But the day of tennis tryouts proves far more fateful than Dan ever could have imagined, when a failed attempt by Truck-kun and the powers that be to kill him and transport his consciousness to a fantasy realm leaves him on Earth with miraculous abilities instead. </p> <p>Stuck on his boring home planet with magical powers to harness and learn, Dan finds himself in a unique situation. Will he use his powers for greatness? Will he abuse them? Or will he simply use them to become the greatest tennis player ever just to chase the girl of his dreams? </p> <p>Who knows? After all, its freshman year and he's got a long way to go. This slice-of-life tennis LitRPG serves up progression, sports, and fun in one hilarious series.</p>";
