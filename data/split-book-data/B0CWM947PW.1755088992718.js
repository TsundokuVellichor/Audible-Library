Now, all he has to do is ensure that Rob still has a home to return to when all is said and done. After defeating a Blighted copy of himself and growing stronger, Jason puts all his efforts into defending Earth from the eldritch monsters that seek to devour it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, sometimes, humans make for the worst kinds of monsters. Jason's investigation into a series of bizarre incidents reveals horrifying experimentation that would put an ordinary mad scientist to shame. Someone is trying to harness the power of the Blight... and they don't care how many people end up suffering along the way.</p> <p>Can't have that happening. Jason and his newly assembled team of misfits refuse to let Earth turn into a madman's personal playground. They're more than happy to introduce some humanity to the good doctor.</p> <p>Preferably by ramming a sword through his face.</p> <p><i>An Outcast in Another World is a LitRPG adventure series with elements of fantasy, isekai, progression, and weak-to-strong. Jason's side story focuses on the world that Rob left behind after being isekai'd. Fight scenes are high-octane duels that involve creative decision-making on Jason's part.</i></p>";
