window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Epic Fantasy LitRPG Adventure</b></p> <p><b>Resources? Zilch. Shelter? Ha. Monsters? Hungry, and closing in.</b><br> <br> Joe the Ritualist fled Alfheim with the remnants of the Dwarven Oligarchy at his side. Though the hairy warriors number in the tens of thousands, they stand at the brink of extinction; and the new world they landed on isnâ€™t pulling any punches. Jotunheim is a winter wonderland featuring a vast array of monsters: the least of which are hulking lizard-ape Hoardlings, and carnivorous penguins standing a dozen feet tall.<br> <br> The world is massive, deadly, and empty: But all Joe sees is free real estate. Thanks to Specializing in magics that allow him to rapidly create buildings, the Ritualist starts carving out a defensible area for his allies. Dense walls, workshops that churn out weapons and armor, even magical edifices that rain death upon the swarming creatures. Being so new to the world, they mistakenly believe that expanding quickly equals safety.<br> <br> But on the world of giants, ramping up production just means ringing a bigger dinner bell.</p>";
