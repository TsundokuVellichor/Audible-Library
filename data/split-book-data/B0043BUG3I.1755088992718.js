Now, an old comrade, Russian arms merchant Sidorenko, returns to force him on a mission against his will: kill Sudan’s President Abboud, the supposed trigger for the Darfur genocide. But the CIA has its own plans for Abboud. With his ruthless employers on one side, his blackmailing former friends on the other, and a doomed mission ahead, Gentry would kill just to get out of this one alive. </p> <p>Every bit as thrilling, informed, and addictive as <i>The Gray Man</i>, and once again skillfully narrated by Jay Snyder, <i>On Target</i> is sure to hit the mark for thriller fans.</p>";
