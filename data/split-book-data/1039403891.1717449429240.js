window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Assassins don’t retire; they reincarnate.</b></p> <p>For nearly all of my life, I trained to become a master assassin, but at the height of my career, it all fell apart. I was betrayed, ambushed, and left bleeding out on the streets of London. Just before my death, though, I was offered a choice: Stay and let my life come to a swift and brutal end, or become the personal assassin of a god in another world. It wasn't a hard decision.</p> <p>But this new world isn’t like the one I left. It operates by a completely different set of rules and a strange system that I don’t understand. I’m going to have to learn fast if I hope to survive in this land of myth and magic. All of my skills, and several new ones, will be put to the test as I receive my first contract. And new world or not, they have no idea who they’re up against.</p> <p><i>Isekai Assassin</i> is a fast-paced story set in a Gamelit dark-fantasy world, written by the best-selling author of the Wyvern Academy series.</p>";
