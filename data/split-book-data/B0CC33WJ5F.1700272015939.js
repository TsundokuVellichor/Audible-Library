window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Could a seemingly average Premier League fan oversee a football club better than a top manager? Max is starting to think so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></p> <p>Max Best is not living his—<i>ahem</i>—best life. His job's a drag, his home's a shooting gallery, his hopes are nil, and lately, even his beloved game of football has devolved from a chaotic, ecstatic delight into a cold, calculating equation complete with stats, tech terms, and mindless lingo. But then Max rescues a mysterious old man from a mugging. \"Nick\" seems friendly enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until he innocently asks his savior, \"Would you sell your soul to be a top football manager?\"</p> <p>Naturally, Max says yes, and in that instant, everything changes. Suddenly, whenever he watches a footie match, the skills and attributes of every player are visible to him within an eyes-only display. While he's terrified at first, he quickly learns to appreciate his abilities—even embracing them to gain his own level-ups and experience. And he's going to need them.</p> <p>Because his otherworldly talent is about to have a massive effect on his real-world existence, catapulting him from small local matches to the insanity of top-tier football. But the more he succeeds, the more he's torn between the simple, happy fanatic he once was and the master of the pitch he's becoming. Soon Max will have to ask himself: Is football really a matter of life or death? Or is there something more important worth fighting for?</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 700,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
