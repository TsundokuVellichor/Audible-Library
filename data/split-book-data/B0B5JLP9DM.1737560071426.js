But this seems to do little to unite the people in working together against the incoming crisis.</p> <p>Still shunned and branded as the Enemy of the World, a lone struggle to gather power and strength continues. A clue the so-called Destroyer had found led him deep into the jungles in the south, into the lands of Panchuria. But waiting for him there were nightmares, created from the hopes of the past.</p>";
