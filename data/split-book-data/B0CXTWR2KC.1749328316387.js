window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Youthful arrogance and misplaced trust left Parsnip's once beautiful aqua colors little more than shades of muted gray.</b></p> <p>As a social pixie and host of a popular TV show, Parsnip desperately needs to fool everyone into believing he's that same, stunningly colorful creature. Warlock-made charms are all Parsnip needs to keep up the rouse. But the financial cost is high, and each activated charm steals more of his life force. Despite this, Parsnip is willing to pay any price. After all, who would want a faded pixie?</p> <p>Everyone knows warlocks have no moral compass. But if that's true, why does Vander Kines turn down more commissions than he accepts? Barely able to keep a roof over his head, his shop open, his brownie ward fed, and beer in the fridge, Vander should jump at the large sums of money clients are willing to throw in his direction. But no amount of cash is worth the cost of his soul, and his only true concern is keeping the young brownie safe.</p> <p>When a magical mishap with Parsnip's warlock sends the pixie through Vander's door, Vander refuses his request until he discovers Parsnip is his one and only. Now, he will go to any lengths to make Parsnip happy—even trading his own life force in place of Parsnip's.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Parsnip isn't fooling everyone, and a witch with a vendetta is determined to expose his secret. She's willing to kill Vander and hand Parsnip over to his worst ogre nightmare to get what she wants.</p> <p>True, unvarnished love is hard to find and sometimes even harder to accept. Having found it, Parsnip's willing to do anything to keep it safe… even if that means giving up his charmed life.</p> <p>Perfectly Charmed Pixie contains <i>beautiful pixies—no matter what their colors, an ornery yet clever brownie, a morally sound warlock, pixie dust-addicted ogres, good and bad witches, a questionably reformed siren, more honeysuckle mead, magic, and finding your perfect other half. It's the third book in the Perfect Pixie series but may be enjoyed as a standalone.</i></p>";
