window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Every road must come to an end.</b></p> <p>THE DEAD. Facing a war where revenants outnumber the living, Caris Rourke must confront a future written in the stars, one she wants no part of. In order to outmaneuver the enemy, Caris must learn to trust her instincts, no matter where they lead, whether into the heart of danger or into the arms of Nathaniel, a dead man walking she should not trust, much less love.</p> <p>THE WAR. Eimarille Rourke wants nothing more than to be queen of all Maricol and will do anything to succeed, even the unthinkable. Determined to claim the starfire throne for herself, she must first eradicate all other claimants. Seeking to assassinate her sister and brother amidst a war of her own making will lead Eimarille down a road of ruin from which there is no turning back.</p> <p>THE LIVING. In the wake of the attack on the Warden's Island, Soren returns to the people who made him into the warden he is today. But the past he thought he'd left behind as a child has given him a name he does not want. Far from the only man he's ever loved, carrying a vow that could change the course of the war, Soren must decide if destroying his life is worth saving a world.</p> <p>THE STARS. In the throes of an escalating war, Vanya Sa'Liandel must put his country above all else, even his own happiness. As Houses seek to betray him and the fallout of his family's past mistakes claws ever closer, not having Soren by his side is an anguish he can't escape. In the end, the tide of war could turn with an alliance he cannot afford to grant. But years ago, Vanya gave his heart to a warden, and some kinds of love weren't meant to burn out but to rage like starfire.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
