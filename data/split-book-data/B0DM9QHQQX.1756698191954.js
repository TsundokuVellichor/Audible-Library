window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Levy plans to use his undervalued specialization of Enchanting to create an unstoppable force.</b></p> <p>As Levy gains the wrong kind of attention from the historic sorcerers who have a stake in the system he hopes to exploit, he soon finds his loyalty in question, and a difficult choice must be taken. Before he can know what to do, he needs to find out the truth about those who have power over him. Some answers are lost in the past, but others seem to be within the system itself. Levy might just have a way to access them through the very thing that has turned him into a threat—his unique connection to mana.</p> <p><i>Levy is a support class dependent on a party and uses mind and magic over strength. This story is a stat-heavy, epic loot hunting, complex magic system navigating, dungeon exploring, party management adventure. All characters are born into this LitRPG world that is rife with ancient sorcerers and historic rivalries.</i></p>";
