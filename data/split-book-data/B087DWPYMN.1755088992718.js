window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The long-lost magic brings doom....</p> <p>We’ve been living in the shadow of the enchanter prophecy since my magic was released, and it seems that the darkness is finally closing in. There’s chaos everywhere; Brinnswick has become a war zone. The human and magical communities are doing everything in their power to save us, but it isn’t enough. Our enemies are countless and more powerful than anything we’ve ever seen. </p> <p>The country has been in turmoil since the berserkers awakened an evil power, and somehow, my magic is connected to it. Ailin doesn’t know yet that the last time this magic was released in our realm, my ancestors sacrificed one of their own in order to keep the evil at bay. I have no doubt that he would burn the world around us in order to save me, but what if my sacrifice could save the world? I don’t want to leave him - he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me - but if my death can guarantee his life, and the lives of our coven, then I’ll do whatever it takes to keep them safe. </p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Heart</i> is the fourth and final book in The Ellwood Chronicles and is a continuation of Sebastian and Ailin’s story. It contains explicit material and is intended for mature adults 18 years of age and older.</p> <p><b>Recommended Listening Order:</b></p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Flame</i></p> <p><i>The Witch’s Seal</i></p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Soul</i></p> <p><i>The Witch’s Blood </i></p> <p><i>The Enchanter’s Heart</i></p>";
