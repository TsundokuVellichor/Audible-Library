window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One Horseman of the Apocalypse down, three more to go.</p> <p>Basil and his team leave France as acclaimed heroes, but a new threat arises in the East: His homeland of Bulgaria is besieged by the mechanical armies of the Unity and their ruthless dragon general, the cruel Blackcinders! With the help of his new ally, the mysterious Kalki, Basil must journey across Europe and show the invaders mankind won't kneel before them.</p> <p>However, challenges are many:</p> <ul> <li>Basil's mother, Aleksandra, is alive somewhere in Bulgari.</li> <li>The Maleking, now short of a Horseman of the Apocalypse, schemes to enter Earth in person.</li> <li>The Blackcinders, who might prove to be the team's deadliest foe yet.</li> </ul> <p>But no one said being the apocalypse tamer would be easy.</p> <p>Book three of a new system LitRPG series from Maxime J. Durand, best-selling author of the Vainqueur the Dragon and The Perfect Run series. Full of equal parts action and laughs, this story is a satirical take on the typical LitRPG apocalypse stories blended with elements of Pok√©mon and <i>Monster Rancher</i>.</p> <p>About the series: Join Basil as he progresses from level one to 100 while refusing to play by the rules of the system. Able to recruit monsters to join him with his [Tamer] class, Basil grows a party of unique creatures to keep him company in the end of the world. They'll experience dungeon diving, battles, and building a little slice of forest into a defensible base.</p>";
