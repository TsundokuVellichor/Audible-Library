window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An old enemy threatens to destroy everything Edwin has achieved in the final installment of this witty and inventive blend of science, fantasy, and LitRPG.</b></p> <p>Life in Joriah isn’t exactly easy . . . especially since it’s only been two years since Edwin Maxlin fell out of the sky and crash-landed in this strange, magical world. Still, despite some near-fatal challenges, he’s managed to make pretty good use of his time. Drawing on his innate blend of curiosity and perseverance, he’s learned spellcasting, forged alliances, and even formed a motley crew of adventurers with whom to journey.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all of Edwin’s exploits have been positive, and a particularly nasty blast from his past has unexpectedly reappeared. It turns out the outlaw alchemist Niall isn’t as dead as Edwin thought. And while Edwin’s been leveling up his skills and learning to fly, Niall’s been perfecting a dangerous type of enchantment. Now, if our unlikely hero hopes to not only save his own skin but also keep his crew from being ripped apart at the seams, he’ll need to draw on every last reserve of cunning and creativity to stop a man who’s truly out for blood.</p> <p>Another irresistible entry in the must-listen series, <i>The Way Ahead 5 </i>is the heart-pounding conclusion of a progression fantasy known for flawless world-building, unforgettable characters, and an ingenious blend of magic and science.</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost four million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible!</b></p>";
