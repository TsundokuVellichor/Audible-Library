Unfortunately, despite his incredible power as a largely solo healer, he quickly discovers that in order to succeed in the final Phase, numerous additional people will need to participate.<br> <br> In other words, he cannot do it alone.<br> <br> The problem that arises is, sadly, an obvious one. While Thaden is powerful and more than capable of tackling many of the challenges that Phase 4 presents, the other Contenders in Region #1, let alone all of the other Regions on Tarth, are <i>far </i>behind the required Level to even have a chance of succeeding against the monsters in the Wildlands. And if he doesn’t find a way to get them to that point, then the deaths of not only every person in Region #1, but the entire world, will become an inevitability.<br> <br> Will Thaden persevere when the odds of success are slim to none? Or will he do something unbelievably stupid and put the lives of everyone on Tarth even more at risk? Find out in the thrilling conclusion of the Earthen Contenders series!</p> <p><i>This story contains an overpowered MC with a normally non-offense-based Class, LitRPG progression mechanics and stats, and isekai/portal fantasy elements.
