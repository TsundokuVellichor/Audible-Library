window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The System has taken the Earth, but all is not lost.</b> </p> <p>With the advantage of the mix-up of starting in the Dungeon, Randidly has been able to found a Village for survivors to gather. With their growing forces, they’ve begun to nurture other outposts of humanity, teaching them the hard-earned lessons he paid for in blood and sweat. </p> <p>Yet the tests thrown at them by the System are not yet done. </p> <p>The Village’s tribulation lurks in nearby Turtletown, fleeing a direct confrontation and wearing many faces. Hordes of monsters gather, preparing to strike when they least expect it. Most worryingly, unsavory characters begin to emerge from amongst the survivors, taking advantage of the chaos to benefit themselves. </p> <p>Amidst this storm, a message comes from Shal. Randidly's teacher needs his assistance to protect the legacy of his family. With the help of Lyra Silver, he hatches a daring plan to finally catch the slippery Tribulation, once and for all. </p> <p>Because even if it takes him to an alien world and requires him to trust the safety of the Village to other survivors, Randidly Ghosthound always pays his debts. </p> <p><b>Book 2 of the hit LitRPG Fantasy series with over 50 Million views on Royal Road is here!</b> </p> <p><b>About the series</b>: Experience a particular flavor of LitRPG/GameLit, where Skill growth and the Path System allow individuals to tailor their growth toward infinite possibilities. There are Classes, Skills, Levels, and Rarities that will feel familiar to any connoisseur of role-playing games. Follow Randidly as he balances his growing power with the worrisome ripples of his existence. The System doesn’t discriminate; when he is ready for more dangerous threats, the rest of humanity better be ready, too. Those who have read the web-novel when it was available online can experience the saga the way it was always meant to be told, fully revised and re-edited, and with tons of new material! </p>";
