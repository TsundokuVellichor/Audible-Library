Is it that hard for them to comprehend that I, the Archmagister of Healing, can't be had so easily? Why, oh why are healers in this world seen as the weakest of the Gifted? It makes no sense to me. In my former world, everybody knew that Healers were to be respected and feared.</p> <p>Ah, well. It won't be long before they wish they'd never crossed my path. I grow all the more powerful with each new day as I come to better understand this world, so full of possibilities, and so very fun!</p>";
