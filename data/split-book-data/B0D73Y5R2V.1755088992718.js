And then, one man traveled back in time to try it all again.</p> <p>A colony has been put on the moon, the deepest seas are being explored, and new miracles are being created every other day. Yet in the shadows lurks a group that has decided Earth and its inhabitants are doomed and has sold out to dark forces beyond reality.</p> <p>Can Isaac manage to stay on top of everything—fighting monsters and playing peacemaker between factions of incredible power, all the while standing against those who represent humanity’s darkest impulses—or will the apocalypse punch back?</p>";
