window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tyson Dawes is back from the dead! Broke, lost, and more pissed off than ever.</b></p> <p>Once the legendary leader of Silken Sands, Tyson's name echoed across the multiverse as the Windowpuncher, the man who tore down the Church of BuyMort and carved out an affiliate that stood for more than just profit margins. But that was a century ago. Betrayed, left to rot in the void, and stripped of everything, Tyson wakes to find his empire gone, his legacy twisted, and the people he cared about most lost to time.</p> <p>But Tyson isn't one to stay down for long.</p> <p>Armed with little more than grit, charisma, and his starfish suit, he sets out to reclaim what was his: Silken Sands. As he battles through corporate cronies, rogue affiliates, and the ghosts of his past, Tyson's fight becomes more than just a power grab. It's a quest to uncover what happened to those he left behind, to face down the friends who became strangers, and to piece together the wreckage of the life he thought he'd lost and accomplish that final goal that Afflqwst had set for him so long ago.</p> <p>The end of BuyMort.</p> <p>BuyMort: Singularity <i>is a darkly satirical, action-packed sci-fi romp through a multiverse where freedom has a price tag, loyalty comes with hidden fees, and even your dog's fate might be part of the fine print. Expect lots of ad crunch, a variety of contemporary situations, and a final quest to the heart of BuyMort itself!</i></p>";
