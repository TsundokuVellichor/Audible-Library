window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Determination is what made Levy a traveler, but only resistance will lead to new levels</b>.</p> <p>Ancient powers are about to collide. The world is on the verge of changing, and all Levy wants is to start leveling.</p> <p>Stuck with a specialization that's mostly used for buffing in towns for coin, Levy doesn't look at it as a disadvantage, even if everyone else does. He expected to take the road most traveled, but it looks like he's going to have to carve his own path and be the first enchanter to reach max level. First, he'd better learn everything he can about the system of mana that seems to have a grudge against mankind…and may even have something to do with the burgeoning war.</p> <p><i>Join Levy on his crunchy, epic loot hunting, complex magic system navigating, dungeon exploring, party management adventure. All characters are born into this LitRPG world that is rife with ancient sorcerers and historic rivalries.</i></p>";
