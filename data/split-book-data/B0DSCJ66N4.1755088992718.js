To compound issues, they are about to reach Tier 15. That means Aster needs to leave for the Bond Academy for at least 10 years. Can they get far enough ahead of the curve to manage, or will this roadblock cause the trio to stumble? </p> <p>Don't miss Book 8 of this action-packed fantasy adventure that blends everything you love about LitRPG with Xianxia. </p> <p><b>About the series: This is a mix between LitRPG and Xianxia. It's like a car that looks like a LitRPG with dungeons and skills, but the interior and engine are all Xianxia. It features a magic system and progression system that are logically and internally consistent, as well as realistic fight scenes and a rational MC.</b></p>";
