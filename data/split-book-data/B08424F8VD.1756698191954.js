I’ve wanted to ask - to beg - for help, but the spell that’s held me captive wouldn’t allow it. </p> <p>With it out in the open, I’m more determined than ever to break the seal from my chest, so I can truly be free. But what if my seal has something to do with one of the most feared prophecies of the millennium?</p> <p><i>“A broken seal breaks the fragile hold...” </i></p> <p>What does that mean? How am I connected? And why do I find myself so deeply drawn to Julius when I know my viramore, my soulmate, is out there somewhere?
