window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Publicly, I'm a sports hero. Privately…</b></p> <p>On the surface, I've got it all. I'm the starting goalie and captain of the Colorado Bulldogs hockey team. I've got more money than I know what to do with. I can count an entire team of elite athletes as my friends. And according to the pundits, I'm an eligible bachelor.</p> <p>That's the image everyone sees, but it's just a role I play, a part dictated by my career. So, those questions I have about why I don't crave sexual contact the way my teammates do, questions I'm afraid to ask with the world watching… I decided a long time ago it didn't make sense to look for answers until after I retired.</p> <p>Then I ran into <i>him</i>.</p> <p>Tripp is loud, obnoxious, and full of confidence. Some people find his sass off-putting, but not me. I find it intriguing, and I admire his ability to be himself, consequences be damned. Apparently, I also admire the way he looks, since my eyes seem to linger on him longer than they should, and when he sets his sights on me…</p> <p>Waiting for retirement to explore who I am seems like too big a sacrifice, so when Tripp offers to help me answer some of those questions about myself, I jump.</p> <p>I'm tired of pretending to be Mr. Perfect. Tripp and his playboy antics might be just the thing I need to figure out who I am outside of hockey. The only problem is everyone—including our mutual friends—sees him as a bad pucking influence.</p> <p><i>Thor meets Tony Hawk in this bi-awakening MM romance about a serious hockey goalie, a bratty skateboarder, a dare involving cake, and a lesson in how to use joysticks—for video games of course.</i></p> <p>Bad Pucking Influence <i> is a queer romance featuring hockey players, not a hockey book featuring LGBTQ+ love. Fans of snarky playboys and gentle giants will enjoy this light-hearted, steamy yet touching love story. This spicy journey contains gay characters, same-sex romance, and themes of acceptance. It's written as book two in the Colorado Bulldogs MM hockey series, and while it can be listened to as a standalone, it's best enjoyed after book one.</i></p>";
