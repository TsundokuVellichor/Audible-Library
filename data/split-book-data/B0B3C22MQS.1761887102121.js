It grows along with you.</b></p> <p>Arthur Leywin may have survived the Relictombs, but he immediately finds himself embroiled in something far more complex and dangerous: Alacryan politics.</p> <p>Accused of crimes he didn’t commit, Arthur is forced to defend himself without drawing the attention of his most powerful enemies.</p> <p>He quickly discovers that the best place to hide may be in plain sight as he continues his quest for the power to control Fate itself. It is a race against time, however, as the greatest threat of the war so far closes in on Arthur’s loved ones in Dicathen. Without him, they are defenseless, but if he returns too soon, all hope is truly lost.</p>";
