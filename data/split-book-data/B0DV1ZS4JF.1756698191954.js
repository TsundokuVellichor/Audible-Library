window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To gain a formidable new card, Arthur must brave the unknown in a hive notorious for its evil side, as this thrilling deck-building fantasy continues.</b></p> <p>Having survived their journey into the Dark Heart, Arthur and his dragon, Brixaby, have a new goal: complete their Legendary card sets. Unfortunately, the next Legendary card is locked away in Blood Moon, a hive with a reputation for chaos, lawlessness, scourgling eruptions, and—rumor has it—dedicated dragon hunters.</p> <p>Still, Arthur and his retinue feel they have little to fear. Then again, they also don't have much knowledge of what actually lies ahead. What they find is a hive full of training and leadership opportunities—if they're able to avoid paying the blood price.</p> <p>But the lure of the Legendary card in the Blood Moon Hive may be a ruse. In fact, it could very well be a trap set by the scourglings themselves. Or something even worse . . .</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit progression fantasy series, featuring a unique card-based magic system, now available for the first time in print!</b></p>";
