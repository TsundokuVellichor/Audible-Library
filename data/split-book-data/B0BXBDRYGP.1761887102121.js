window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As he navigates a strange new world, Edwin weighs forming alliances and deciding who to trust, in the fourth book of this smart, entertaining fantasy series.</b></p> <p>Ever since Edwin Maxlin literally fell out of the sky and landed in Joriah, life has been a little bit complicated. For one thing, he’s adapting to a new world that’s nothing like Earth. For another, he’s learning magic, leveling up skills, and adjusting his scientific knowledge to a whole new set of natural rules. Plus, he’s an outsider maneuvering the dangerous politics of an empire he knows zilch about. No wonder he hasn’t had much time to rest.</p> <p>Having devoted himself to training and studying (when he’s not building incredible new inventions!), Edwin’s finally starting to get somewhat of a handle on all his new abilities—with the help of fellow adventurer Lefi and water naiad Inion. But as his quest for improvement brings him closer to the mysterious and mystically powerful Rillah, he’s faced with a new set of obstacles. Because in a world where his very existence could make him a target, Edwin must be very careful about who he lets get close . . .</p> <p>Effortlessly combining elements of high fantasy, character-driven storytelling, and the scientific method, <i>The Way Ahead 4</i> is the fun, funny, and fantastically addictive next chapter of a remarkable quest.</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 3.5 million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>";
