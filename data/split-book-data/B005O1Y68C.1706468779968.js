window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a nation on the brink of war, a young art student's star-crossed love begins to bloom in the first book of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling epic fantasy trilogy by award-winning author Laini Taylor.</b></p> <p>Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.</p> <p>In a dark and dusty shop, a devil's supply of human teeth grown dangerously low.</p> <p>And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherworldly war.</p> <p>Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real; she's prone to disappearing on mysterious \"errands\"; she speaks many languages—not all of them human; and her bright blue hair actually grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she's about to find out.</p> <p>When one of the strangers—beautiful, haunted Akiva—fixes his fire-colored eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past. But will Karou live to regret learning the truth about herself?</p>";
