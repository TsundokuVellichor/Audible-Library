window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Peaches is a nature pixie.</b></p> <p>Fully bonded to his orchard, he can only leave his land for a finite time. Plants, soil, daylight, and every living thing Mother Nature has on tap flow like liquid sunshine through Peaches' lively veins.</p> <p>Lucroy Moony was born into his vampiric second life over six hundred years ago. King of the Southeastern nest in the United States, Lucroy is responsible for more than his bar, Dusk. Lucroy only comes alive when the sun goes down. The moon and stars are his backdrop—the sun the quickest path to a pile of ash. Death and darkness fill Lucroy's body with borrowed blood.</p> <p>Pixies and vampires couldn't be more different, and yet, Lucroy and Peaches find themselves drawn together time and again. But vampire myth cautions that pixie blood is deadly, and Lucroy's willing to put that tale to the test. Nothing that smells as temptingly delicious as Peaches's blood can be toxic. Right?</p> <p>Lucroy wants nothing more than to court fate with his pixie, but someone's been whispering in the vampire council's ears, and they aren't pleased to learn Lucroy killed a werewolf to save a pixie. If the council decides Lucroy was in the wrong, his life is forfeit, and the nest he's tried so hard to protect could be left in sadistic hands.</p> <p>Lucroy needs to convince the council that pixies aren't toxic but precious creatures. And, more importantly, one pixie, in particular, is his beloved—his perfectly perfect pixie, Peaches.</p> <p><i>Perfectly Perfect Pixie </i>has an HEA and contains a willful nature pixie, a smitten vampire bar owner, pixie dust eating sprites, and a smattering of dwarf, werewolf, and fairy intrigue. Be warned, there is vampire violence, and a few heads will roll.</p> <p><i>Perfectly Perfect Pixie </i>is a standalone, but for full enjoyment, listen to <i>Perfectly Imperfect Pixie </i>first.</p>";
