window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Smart men never dabble with demons. I never claimed to be smart, but at least, I’m powerful enough to control them. When I bound Havoc to me nearly 300 years ago, I never realized how difficult he’d make my life, although “accidentally” lighting him on fire every now and then does bring a smile to my face.</p> <p>Havoc is handsome, mysterious, and somehow, my closest companion, even if we don’t always get along. He’s more interested in bedding attractive women than protecting my life, which defeats the main reason a mage like me would have a demon. I even had to fight off swordsmen alone once because he was too busy betting on who’d survive. </p> <p>When 15 people are found dead with messages from a long-extinct cult, Havoc and I are forced to face our past and sort through our differences. We start to realize that there’s something more to this relationship, something that has kept us by each other’s sides for so long. Maybe, it took 300 years to finally understand my feelings for Havoc and realize that I can’t imagine being with anyone but him.</p> <p>Havoc and I will do everything we can to stop the evil that is threatening the lives of the people I care about. Or destroy everything - we haven’t quite figured that out yet. </p> <p><i>Happy Endings</i> is a 73K word novel that has an immensely powerful mage, a shapeshifting demon with a strong libido, a dark mage that just won’t stay dead, a spray bottle put to unusual uses, armor that is most definitely not made of dragon skin, blackmail involving an unfortunate slow-mo video, a detective being pursued by a determined minotaur, unprofessional use of illusions, and an epic walk into battle.</p> <p>Revised and edited.</p>";
