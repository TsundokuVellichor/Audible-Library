window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s Drop Night, the one night every decade when the gods hand out cards to a lucky few. If you get a deck, you’re a deckbearer capable of wondrous feats within the Great Game system. You can control powerful monsters and summon mantles that let you fight alongside your beasts.</p> <p>Ethan Wolfe, top enforcer for the Grimm family mob, has already been overlooked on two previous Drop Nights. People of his ilk seldom receive cards, as the gods tend to favor people who follow their divine mandates, but that doesn’t mean Wolfe can’t hope.</p> <p>Unfortunately, when Wolfe does get his deck, he doesn’t have time to celebrate. The rival street gang has six deckbearers and they’re cutting in on the Grimm family’s trade. Someone has to do the dirty work, and it isn’t going to be the spoiled children of Big Man Grimm.</p> <p>And things might get worse for Wolfe when everyone figures out he received an ultra-rare card in his deck…</p> <p>With hundreds of thousands of views on Royal Road, this definitive version is perfect for fans of Goblin Summoner, Card Mage, and All the Skills.</p>";
