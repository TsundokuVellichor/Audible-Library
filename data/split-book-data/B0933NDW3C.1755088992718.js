In the weeks since the pitched battle with the Ghoul Nurse-matron, he’s cleaned up so many vampire infestations that he’s on auto-pilot. He’d rather be out honing his heroic magic into something truly legendary.</p> <p>Occasionally, he remembers that his name is Arthur Mallory: a real person with a family, and maybe even some friends. Trapped in this virtual world, his attempts to log out have ended only in failure and migraines. It’s easier to just forget, especially with otherworldly invaders draining Nightfall’s aether - the source of his beloved magic. He must embrace every source of power he can find if he expects to stop them.</p> <p>As that power begins to change Korrash, will there be enough of Arthur left to rescue?</p>";
