window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>An action-packed LitRPG Apocalypse perfect for fans of The Primal Hunter, Road to Mastery, and The Ten Realms.</i></p> <p><b>In a world of countless enemies, Freddy's unique power will help him thrive.</b></p> <p>Freddy Stern, a twenty-one-year-old cashier, has lived a plain, albeit harsh life. Having been orphaned—twice—he's spent the last ten years working and staying out of trouble. His only aspiration is to save enough money to become an archhuman.<br> <br> His dream gets the jump on him when he barely survives a near-death encounter and finds himself in possession of 1% Lifesteal, a bizarre talent with numerous contradictions and just as many uses.<br> <br> With every dead enemy, he becomes a bit stronger, a little wiser, and a lot more ruthless. And no matter how much damage he takes, he can always put himself back together. Physically, at least.<br> <br> But on his path to power, after having to look at the rotting guts of archhuman society again and again, can his talent keep his mind and soul as pristine as his body?<br> <br> Or will that part of him simply remain broken...<br> <br> <b>Experience the start of this action-packed LitRPG Adventure from Robert Blaise set two hundred years after a reality-altering apocalypse. Featuring a weak-to-strong Brawler MC who never backs down, a unique power system, apocalyptic elements and more!</b></p>";
