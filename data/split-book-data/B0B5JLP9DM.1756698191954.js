window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The First Calamity failed to put an end to a decade full of conspiracy and betrayal.</b> </p> <p>Even as the heroes of old return to the front stage as the world's adversary–as was foretold–the way forward is fraught with traps and machinations by those who seek to further their own objectives with no regard to the harm they bring upon the innocents.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the world is still afflicted by the ticking time bomb in the form of the Curse of Extinction that can extinguish the light of mankind all on its own, independent from even the mighty Calamities. But this seems to do little to unite the people in working together against the incoming crisis.</p> <p>Still shunned and branded as the Enemy of the World, a lone struggle to gather power and strength continues. A clue the so-called Destroyer had found led him deep into the jungles in the south, into the lands of Panchuria. But waiting for him there were nightmares, created from the hopes of the past.</p>";
