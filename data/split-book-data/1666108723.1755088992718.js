window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With the Stronghold of Eredain secured against the Darkness, Aranos and his party are finally free to travel to the lost city of Antas and pursue Geltheriel's Cleansing Quest. Phil and his new party are leveled up and ready to meet Aranos there. Surely, the combined powers and talents of both parties will make short work of the city's defenders!</p> <p>Nothing is ever that simple in Singularity Online, though. There are still mysteries appearing in Eredain. The High Roads are far more dangerous than anything Aranos faced in the Blightlands, and the city of Antas has already repelled assaults from both human and elven armies...with no survivors returning. Discovering the more potent Enhanced Aspects of magic will help Aranos penetrate the Library of Antas and its secret Vault, but just using them could destroy him.</p> <p>At the same time, Aranos has to learn about his new noble title and how to build the fledgling House Evenshade through alliances and the efforts of the group of Travelers that once tried to kill him but now call him their Lord. Yet, it seems as if a hidden hand is working to bring his House down almost before he's built it.</p>";
