What should have been a moment to bask in success came crashing down around him when he inadvertently exposed a demonic cultivator cabal. Realizing that a moving target is harder to strike, Sen flees into the wilds with Lifen and Lo Meifeng in tow.</p> <p>There, he’ll learn that not all enemies want to take your life and not every threat can be met with the edge of a blade. Sen must delve deeper inside himself and push his cultivation harder than ever before or risk losing something more precious than his life… He’ll lose his soul.</p>";
