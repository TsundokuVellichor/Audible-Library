window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Quiet days are to be treasuredâ€”but sooner or later, they always end.</b></p> <p>After curing the Corruption plague in Fiend territory, Rob, Riardin's Rangers, and the Deserters have settled into their new home. It's given them the stability they've been striving for ever since being forced to flee The Village so many months ago. Unfortunately, their well-earned rest is cut short when a Dwarven messenger arrives, begging for assistance.</p> <p>The Blight has returned. And without Rob's help, Dwarven territory will fall.</p> <p>Naturally, things aren't that straightforward. As the mission evolves into something even beyond killing an eldritch abomination, Rob's strength and willpower will be tested. Whether it's mingling with world leaders, contemplating the Dragon Queen's fraying sanity, or discovering shocking secrets about the system itself, there's never a dull moment for Riardin's Rangers. Maybe one day they'll get the lasting peace they so desperately desire.</p> <p>But for now, there are enemies that need killing.</p>";
