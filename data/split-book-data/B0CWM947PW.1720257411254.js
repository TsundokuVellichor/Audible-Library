After defeating a Blighted copy of himself and growing stronger, Jason puts all his efforts into defending Earth from the eldritch monsters that seek to devour it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, sometimes, humans make for the worst kinds of monsters. Jason's investigation into a series of bizarre incidents reveals horrifying experimentation that would put an ordinary mad scientist to shame. Someone is trying to harness the power of the Blight... and they don't care how many people end up suffering along the way.</p> <p>Can't have that happening.
