window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In pursuit of magical power, a young warrior finds himself waging war on behalf of a subjugated people—and becoming a king—in this dark-fantasy adventure.</b></p> <p>Half-human, half-demon, Zeke Blackwood has become a legendary warrior and wielder of mana. To the kobolds he's Ak-toh—Savior. The centaurs call him <i>Spear of the People.</i> Both species have rallied to his side along with beastkin, elves, and other creatures who've sworn allegiance to him. They're willing to sacrifice themselves while he fulfills a quest on behalf of the god Oberon: to be the greatest fighter in the forthcoming apocalyptic battle between good and evil.</p> <p>But the realm is overrun with malice and cruelty. The Knights of Adontis enslave every species they consider subhuman, the very ones following Zeke. To liberate them, Zeke must unleash his wrath against enemies who wield demonic mana that threatens to corrupt his body and soul. As his kingdom of loyal subjects and soldiers grows larger and more diverse, he'll need to find the balance between reigning as a just ruler and a merciless tyrant.</p> <p>With every victory, Zeke's strength and skills grow, as does his ability to conjure destructive magic. Torn between his human and demonic natures, he's evolving into something far beyond either. Something unworldly, possessing incalculable power . . . A god.</p> <p><b>The eighth volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
