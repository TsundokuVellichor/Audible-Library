window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Maximilian is the last of the noble Valevsky lineage. His entire family was put to death for an alleged attempt on the powerful Duke of Odoevsky, who had his eye set on the Valevsky's land.</p> <p>The young man managed to avoid execution, but not punishment. From here on out, he's condemned to life as a doomed soldier. The front line in the fight against the dark god Skron's mutated creatures. \"Do or die\"â€”that's the doomer motto that has been drilled into the last of the Valevsky's head. The Duke took everything from him but his honor and a thirst for revenge.</p> <p>He made a vow that he'd dig himself out of this hole he's been driven into and lay claim to his birthright. But first, he needs to get through training and survive. A rookie doomer can't afford to dream of anything else.</p>";
