window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"My name is Mike Ross and I'm a Ferryman - like in the Greek myth. I didn't ask for, or really want, the job, but I'm trying to make the best of it. Most ghosts are okay and just need a little help to get where they need to go. Unfortunately, there are lots of exceptions, like power-mad psychopaths, spirits still trying to fight battles long since lost, and the worst of the lot - the Skinwalkers. They live vicariously by possessing people and controlling them like puppet masters. Then they toss them aside when they've outlived their usefulness. One of them stole my father 15 years ago, and now I'm going to make that ghost pay.\"</p>";
