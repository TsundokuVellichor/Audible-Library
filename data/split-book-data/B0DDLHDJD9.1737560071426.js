Anyway, Danny Kendrick was a down-on-his luck performer who always struggled to find his place. He certainly never wanted to be a hero. He just hoped to earn a living doing what he loved.</p> <p>That all changes when he pisses off the wrong guy and gets sucked into a fantasy realm straight out of a Renaissance Fair.</p> <p>Getting used to a new world is tough. It's even tougher when you're surrounded by axe-wielding barbarians, super hot elf assassins, strange magic, and a jaded System that doesn't appear interested in being charged with yet another companion.</p> <p>Danny must adapt fast, turn on the charm, and learn to accept his given Class if he hopes to master it and survive this dangerous new place.</p> <p>But he has a knack for finding trouble. Gifted what seems like an innocent ancient lute after making a questionable deal with a Hag, Danny becomes the target of mysterious factions who seek to claim its power.</p> <p>It's up to him, Screenie, and his new barbaric friend, Curr, to uncover the truth and become the heroes nobody knew they needed. And maybe, just maybe, Danny will finally find a place where he belongs. Perhaps, even where he'll thrive.</p> <p><b>Jump into this fantasy isekai LitRPG Adventure filled with unforgettable characters, loveable companions, unlikely heroes, slow-build power, progression, and plenty of comedy.
