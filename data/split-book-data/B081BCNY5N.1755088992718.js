There are new game elements, new enemies, and even new locations.</p> <p>After just barely surviving his first boss fight, Hall finds himself in one of those new locations. He's become the lord of a ruined and isolated village called Skara Brae, deep in the middle of hostile territory.</p> <p>Hall and his companions must make the long trek to the city of Silverpeak Keep for much-needed supplies, or they'll risk losing everything. He hopes the journey will help determine what to do with Skarra Brae, his new in-game home.</p> <p>What he thought would be a simple journey through the foothills of the Thunder Growl Mountains becomes so much more. From raging undead to a gang war between two thieves guilds, Hall will need new allies to survive more surprises than ever before. And the threat of permadeath still looms.</p> <p><b>The hit new litRPG series Sky Realms Online continues with </b><b><i>Silverpeak</i></b><b>. It's perfect for fans of J. A. Hunter, Dakota Krout, and Edward Brody.</b></p> <p><i>Performed by Pavi Proczko, narrator of Eden's Gate and Continue Online.</i></p>";
