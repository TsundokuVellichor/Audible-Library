window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this new stand-alone novella from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Laini Taylor comes the story of a romantic, funny, and fantastical first date. In <i>Night of Cake &amp; Puppets</i>, Taylor brings to life a night only hinted at in the Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone Trilogy - the magical first date of fan-favorites Zuzana and Mik. Told in alternating perspectives, it's the perfect love story for fans of the series and new listeners alike. </p> <p>Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her \"rabid fairy,\" her \"voodoo eyes\" are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or \"Violin Boy,\" her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to meet him, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. It's a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winter's night before finally leading him to the treasure: herself! </p> <p>Violin Boy's not going to know what hit him. </p>";
