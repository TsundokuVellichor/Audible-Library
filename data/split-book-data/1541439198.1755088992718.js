Fate, however, is fickle and Regan ends up as a Dungeon Core...with <i>all </i>his memories. Is the world of Murgin ready to face such a dungeon? Let's find out....</p> <p>Earth 2150.

Or at least, that's what everyone thought until a year later Earle himself sent out a message. A message that stated his creations would shut down if he were killed. He even went so far as to place a beacon on top of his building that broadcasted his location. The humans fought against the machines for decades in a futile attempt to destroy the tower. Until one day....</p>";
