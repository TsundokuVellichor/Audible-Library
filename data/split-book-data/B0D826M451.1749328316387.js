window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I can't take it anymore. This curse, this undead curse… It makes it so every moment is nothing but pure torment.</b></p> <p>I need to keep busy, to take my mind off of it and alleviate the pain. More than that, I need to find a way to rebuild my powers after I was tricked by my own allies, slain, and reborn.</p> <p>I can't return to the human lands yet. The pact of non-aggression still stands. This leads me to accept a contract that will bring me to the land of the Witch Elves. A place where great dangers lurk—demons and abominations— but also tremendous power.</p> <p>In those ruins lays a weapon that allows the wielder to channel his discordance right into it to gain tremendous attacks and abilities. That blade is only one among a plethora of game-changing artifacts… That might very well be the key to my ascension.</p> <p>Because yes, the Cult of the Veil may be growing stronger, with new followers joining the ranks every day, and I may be starting to feel their worship empowering me… But if I am to climb my way up to actual godhood, I will need much more than a small congregation. I will need to capture cities and build temples and altars to boost my numbers. And for that, I will need every edge I can get.</p> <p>With so many threats lurking around the corner, I have no choice. Becoming the Godking may be the only true option I have to ensure my survival in the long run.</p>";
