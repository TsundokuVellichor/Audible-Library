window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A virtual world filled with horrors. The real world is doubly so. A terrifying body count is rising.</b></p> <p>Arthur Mallory is trapped in a heavenly prison, a virtual-reality game, forced to play as Korrash: a powerful elven mage. He’s desperately waiting on his friends and family in the real world to rescue him, but they don’t have the faintest idea where he actually is...or just how high the stakes truly are.</p> <p>The answers are held by the OneiroSoft corporation: Arthur’s employer-turned-kidnapper. The game world, Nightfall, is consumed by change. Mana runs rampant, the formerly peaceful kingdom now a dangerous land filled with mighty Spirit Beasts, and ancient and powerful beings are free to twist humanity to meet their dark ends. His friends are dying, and his homeland is in ruins; Korrash knows he must act.</p> <p>A quest points him toward the world’s salvation: the Resetti Stone. With its power, he can banish the darkness he unleashed upon the world and set everything right again. He’s <i>sure </i>of it.</p>";
