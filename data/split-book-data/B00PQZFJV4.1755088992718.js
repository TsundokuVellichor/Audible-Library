window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A new short story in the Mindspace Investigations universe (with two bonus short stories in other worlds from author Alex Hughes). </p><p><b>Open Mind</b></p><p>When the cops call me in the middle of the night, I know it's bad. One of their own is dead, strangled in her car by a professional killer, and it's up to me, telepath consultant extraordinaire, to pull the rabbit out of my hat and solve the case. Only this time I'm not so sure I can. Homicide Detective Isabella Cherabino is breathing down my neck. The dead cop's partner is too. And now, the worst - there was a five-year-old kid in the car, a kid no one can find. Note from the author: <i>Rabbit Trick</i> takes place before the events of <i>Clean</i>, so the hero intentionally remains nameless.</p>";
