window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young man finds himself trapped in a nightmarish realm beyond belief in the second installment of this action-packed LitRPG/gamelit series.</b></p> <p>Lukas Aguilar used to think he knew everything. Mainly because he believed only what he could prove for himself. No gods, fate, or any such nonsense for him. But that seems like a lifetime ago. Because when an earthquake destroyed his earthly home, he suddenly found himself in a dark dungeon world where gods and monsters are all too real—and supreme goddess Inanna had taken up residence in his mind.</p> <p>Upon learning the rules of his new existence—levels, skills, abilities—Lukas fought his way from victory to victory. That is, until he came up against an anomaly that got him killed (at least for a month or so). When he finally reawakes, Inanna is gone, and his own powers have increased exponentially. But that victory comes at a cost.</p> <p>Now Lukas finds himself in a borderland, beyond the reach of the Asukan Gods and rife with ever more lethal paths. They may lead him to Inanna . . . or to his ultimate demise . . . or to ancient secrets that could shatter the very foundation of this world. The only thing that's certain is any path he chooses will result in a whole lot of death and destruction.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with almost a million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!</b></p>";
