window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Build. Evolve. Conquer. Welcome to the dawn of a whole new kind of Boss Battle…</b></p> <p>Roark von Graf has been fighting for one thing since the night his family was slaughtered: to kill the Tyrant King. Even when he was transported to a strange new world called a VRMMORPG, Roark recruited an army of Trolls, built a nation of high-level Dungeons, and crushed his opposition through trickery, seedy alliances, and sheer overwhelming force, all in service of revenge.</p> <p>But the Tyrant King was two steps ahead all along, and now Roark and everyone he cares about are trapped in a land where there are no respawns, no second chances. Every death is forever-death, and Marek is looking to plant his head on a spike.</p> <p>If Roark’s going to survive the onslaught of the Tyrant King’s forces and finish Marek once and for all, he’ll have to overcome the massive difference in their levels, fend off a Health-draining curse, unlock the ultimate cheat, and find a way to use the very fabric of reality as a weapon… all without a single extra life.</p> <p>This is the end, the final showdown between tyranny and freedom, and all of creation hangs in the balance.</p> <p>From James A. Hunter—author of <i>Bibliomancer, Shadowcroft Acadmey for Dungeons</i>, and <i>Viridian Gate Online</i>—and Eden Hudson, author of <i>Path of the Thunderbird</i> and <i>Death Cultivator</i>, comes the final installment in the bestselling Rogue Dungeon series!</p>";
