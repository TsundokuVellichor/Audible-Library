window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sam hates his office job, but at least every night he can delve into Alterwhere and forget about stupid teamwork for a while.</b></p> <p>The world’s hottest new cerebral reality game is a fully immersive mash-up of the retro fantasy RPGs he used to play on his dad’s steam account back in the early 2030s—the kind where you can eat a bowl of stew in the middle of a battle, fire crossbows underwater, and steal all the plates from an NPC’s kitchen as long as they’re looking away at the time.</p> <p>As Sam sets out to solo champion monsters and drink mind-altering potions, he realizes the greedy devs are working hard to monetize their free-to-play model. On top of morally questionable microtransactions, he must also contend with a mob-thieving elf, the unexpected success of his alchemical experimentations, a mind-bending crossover of game life and reality, and—worst of all—if he’s not careful, he might even be in danger of making some real friends.</p> <p><i>Old Man Gamer</i> is a fresh and comedic LitRPG that pokes fun at tropes both new and old. A standalone story, it is primarily concerned with gaming, and contains some violence, a fair whack of drug and alcohol use, mild romantic interludes, and surprisingly little cursing (not sure how that happened).</p>";
