Grow strong enough to stop the Cataclysm.</b></p> <p>Orodan was an orphaned street rat who clawed his way to the county militia with hard work. When calamitous events unfold and draw him into events bigger than himself, Orodan's battle-loving disposition leads to a warrior's death.<br> <br> Then he wakes up again at the start of the Cataclysm. Then again. And again.</p> <p>In a world of skills, titles, and blessings, a smart time-looper would perhaps scheme, plan, amass equipment, and allies. But not Orodan. If there's one thing he's good at, it's stubbornly trying the same thing over and over again via brute force till it's done.</p> <p>If a wall is in front of him, going around is not an option. Instead, he'll batter it thousands of times until either the wall breaks or he does. And gain skill levels along the way.<br> <br> Until, maybe one run, he'll grow powerful enough to stop the Cataclysm.</p> <p><b>Experience this fast-paced LitRPG Adventure about Orodan and his progression toward becoming extremely overpowered using a time loop. The series features a detailed system, loads of skills, varied progression paths, deep worldbuilding, cultivation aspects, and a heroic character you can't help but root for!</b></p>";
