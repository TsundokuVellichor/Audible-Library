window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now sixteen years old, Eight is a fixture in both the Glen and Voorhei, helping to defend his adopted homes from the relentless monsters drawn by the Deer God's influence. Yet, peace is fleeting in a world where magic and danger intertwine.</b></p> <p>The arrival of Aslishtei's nieces brings an unexpected proposition: an expedition to Old Baxteiyel. The hierophant of Albei has turned the ruins into the site of a deadly race, pitting teams against one another to claim the treasures hidden within. But Aslishtei's nieces have a different plan. For them, the race is a distraction—a cover for their true goal of uncovering the secrets of the fabled Arc of Knowledge within the ruins.</p> <p>The journey is fraught with peril. Dark warriors guard Old Baxteiyel's mysteries, and the Maltran Empire's agents lurk in the shadows, intent on sabotage and spreading chaos. As Eight and his team delve into the ruins, they face battles not only with the ruins' defenders but also with their own doubts and desires. For Eight, the expedition is more than an adventure; it's a confrontation with his growing yearning for the unknown and the toll it takes on those he loves, particularly Ikfael, who cannot stray for long from her territory.</p> <p>The clash with Baxteiyel's dark warriors changes everything. The choices made and bonds tested in the ruins send ripples far beyond the battlefield, leaving Eight to grapple with the aftermath and the profound shift in his relationship with Ikfael.</p> <p><i>Eight: New Blood, Old Bones</i> is a tale of daring exploration, cunning strategies, and the sacrifices demanded by ambition and love. The ruins hold secrets that could reshape the world, but at what cost? Join Eight on his most dangerous journey yet, where every step challenges not just his strength, but the very foundations of his life.</p>";
