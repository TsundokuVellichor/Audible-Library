window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A wizard's mansion. A menagerie of magical creatures. One grimoire&nbsp;bonded to a seemingly ordinary young man from London.</b></p> <p>When Joe Ramsey took a job in a quaint yet otherwise ordinary part of&nbsp;London, the last thing he expected to find was a house filled to the&nbsp;brim with magic. The peculiar man who called himself a wizard has now&nbsp;offered Joe a job. He's to be caretaker to the magical creatures who&nbsp;live in the wizard's house.</p> <p>It's not long, however, before Joe finds himself bonded with one such&nbsp;creature: a grimoire. Good thing, too, because if he's going to ensure&nbsp;all the other creatures remain safe on the grounds, he'll need to&nbsp;learn magic. And if there's one thing the grimoire can teach him, it's magic.</p> <p>But the grimoire holds other secrets, ones the darker side of the&nbsp;supernatural world would do anything to uncover.</p>";
