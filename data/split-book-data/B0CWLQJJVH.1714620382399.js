window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A powerful mind. A robust body. Both are needed to survive dead gods and zealots.</b></p> <p>After clashing fiercely with Fellhorn's followers, Argrave has been forever altered by the desert's crucible. Awaiting him as he makes his way back to his homeland are faces from the past â€“ friends and foes, all unprepared for his transformation.</p> <p>Argrave now ventures into the core of a land besieged by plague, forced to ally with his unpredictable, fervently passionate brother: Orion. Wielding strength that borders on the mythical, Orion might just hold the key to quelling the foul force spawning the unnatural pestilence. Yet, alliances are as delicate as they are dangerous. If Orion discovers the source of the change Argrave has endured, the lines between brother and enemy could blur in an instant.</p> <p>His transformation is both a weapon and a wildcard, meaning Argrave needs to dance on the razor's edge of saving the land... and not being burned as a heretic.</p>";
