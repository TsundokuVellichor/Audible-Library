window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Dominic's world had been a fairly simple life.</b></p> <p>To live his life to the best of his abilities, gain experience, level up, and strive to enjoy himself as best as he could in a backwater. Which, while tough on its own, was made infinitely harder by his father being the local executioner.</p> <p>All of that becomes infinitely worse when his entire family is murdered. Now, he's the Prince-in-Hiding for a nearly non-existent royal family.</p> <p>Several Dukes have risen up in rebellion in his stead to put him in power without ever having met him. Men and women are dying across the country, all for his sake, without him even having ever seen the capital.</p> <p>All for Dominic Randolph, the Dragon-King.</p> <p>Except that this isn't even the least of his problems.</p> <p>A Dungeon has collapsed without a known reason. This is most certainly an ominous beginning to a new phase of the war, something more sinister beginning, or a change in the very fabric of what they thought they knew about Dungeons.</p> <p>Nick must now push ever onward to reclaim a throne he doesn't even know the color of because if he doesn't, there's no telling who might step into the breach to take it.</p> <p>Armed with his family's weapons, Lucian's guidance, and his companions, Domnic's adventure continues.</p> <p><i>Narrated in duet style.</i></p>";
