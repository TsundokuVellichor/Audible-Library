He certainly had no plans to be put in the unenviable position of being the leader of a guild. But if there’s one thing that he excels at, it certainly isn’t cooking. No, he’s far better at rolling with the punches and making sure the people around him survive. When literal monsters are everywhere, that’s the kind of person you want in charge.</p> <p>But this world isn’t what he’s been expecting. Things are different. He is different. By succeeding so much, so fast, humanity has unlocked the next stage of the Juxtaposition, years before they’re ready for it. A legendary weapon is up for grabs, and the first guild to grab it will solidify their stranglehold of Kansas City. All Nacho needs to do is find a path to something he’s never heard of before, look for something that shouldn’t exist, and keep his people alive.</p> <p>Time to hold on tight and chase that dragon.</p>";
