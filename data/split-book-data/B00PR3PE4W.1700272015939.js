window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nothing ruins a romantic evening like a brawl with lowlifes - especially when one of them later turns up dead and my date, Detective Isabella Cherabino, is the number one suspect. My history with the Atlanta PD on both sides of the law makes me an unreliable witness, so while Cherabino is suspended, I'm paying my bills by taking an FBI gig. I've been hired to play telepathic bodyguard for Tommy, the 10-year-old son of a superior court judge in Savannah presiding over the murder trial of a mob-connected mogul. After an attempt on the kid's life, the Feds believe he's been targeted by the businessman's \"associates\".Turns out, Tommy's a nascent telepath, so I'm trying to help him get a handle on his Ability. But it doesn't take a mind reader to see that there's something going on with this kids parents that's stressing him out more than a death threat...</p>";
