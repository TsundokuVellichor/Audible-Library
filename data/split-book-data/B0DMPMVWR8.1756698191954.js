Seemingly no easy task, as the mischief spirit is beyond picky about her future body. But on his way to Oakland, Finch stumbles upon the dead body of a social media star—both a solution <i>and</i> a major problem.<br> <br> Oakland is teeming with werewolves, full moon witches, vampires, and redwood elves, most of whom aren’t on good terms with Finch. Navigating the supernatural world to gather clues about the murder is hard enough, but now Finch must also dodge old enemies and rivals. And to make matters worse, the murderer just might be trailing Finch, now that he’s found the body.<br> <br> Good thing Finch has a pact with Chronos. With time on his side, perhaps he can do the impossible…<br> <br> <b>Continue this urban fantasy series in the second book of the Chronos Chronicles!</b></p>";
