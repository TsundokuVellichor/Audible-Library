window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>War rages in the lands of Light, and the Darkness seems to be winning. Cities fall as the mad player Lily leads her armies against them, and hordes of Shadowborn descend on the Lightborn, seeking their destruction and enslavement. The Dark Pantheon itself has taken up arms against Aranos and his party, and he has only days to finish Redeeming the Arcane Doors before his Quest fails—which means the end of Geltheriel and the defeat of the Light.</p> <p>To overcome the Darkness, Aranos must delve deeper than he ever has into his arcane powers, but even his Primal magic may not be enough when the Darkbringer herself, Queen of the Dark Pantheon, stands against him. Only by transcending his mortal limits and understanding the deepest truths of Singularity can he hope to face the horrors opposing him. To save everyone, he may have to lose everything and everyone he loves . . .</p> <p>What price will he pay to become the Sorcerer Eternal?</p>";
