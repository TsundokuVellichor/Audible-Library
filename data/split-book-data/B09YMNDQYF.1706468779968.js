window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Prof. Brandt Savage—grandson of the legendary action hero—is forced into a top-secret training program where he discovers his true calling...as the perfect assassin.</b></p> <p>Dr. Brandt Savage is on sabbatical from the University of Chicago. Instead of doing solo fieldwork in anthropology, the gawky, bespectacled PhD finds himself enrolled in a school where he is the sole pupil. His professor, “Meed,” is demanding. She’s also his captor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Savage emerges from their intensive training sessions physically and mentally transformed, but with no idea&nbsp;<i>why&nbsp;</i>he’s been chosen, and&nbsp;<i>how&nbsp;</i>he’ll use his fearsome abilities. Then his first mission with Meed takes them back to her own training ground, where Savage learns how deeply entwined their two lives have been.&nbsp;To prevent a new class of killers from escaping this harsh place where their ancestors first fought to make a better world, they must pledge anew :&nbsp;<i>Do right to all, and wrong to no one</i>.</p>";
