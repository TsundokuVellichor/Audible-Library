window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Stormking has brokered an uneasy peace with the West, but the threat of an elven invasion looms in the East.</b></p> <p>Hoping to prevent a bloody war, Will departs in search of the mythical hidden gate to the elven homeland and believes the country is safe in his absence.</p> <p>He is wrong.</p> <p>Adept at manipulation, the elves seek to conquer from within, and their spies have already infiltrated the kingdom. As Selene prepares to defend her throne, she discovers that the elven plot runs deeper than the blackest shadows. Duty demands she put her nation first, but a loathsome ally urges a darker choice. Beset by foes and without the Stormking, she has never been so alone… or vulnerable.</p> <p>She cannot win without power. To gain it, she must embrace an ancient evil or make the ultimate sacrifice. But she is Selene, the lich queen of Terabinia, and defiance is in her blood. When the hour comes, she will rise to face her legacy—and curse—as the Daughter of the Dragon.</p>";
