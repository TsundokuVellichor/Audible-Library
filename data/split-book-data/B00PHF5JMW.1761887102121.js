window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Being a telepath, I should have seen the hell I was getting myself into - I used to be one of the most powerful telepaths in the guild. That was before my drug addiction and before they kicked me out. But I'm not a bad guy. Now I help the Atlanta PD solve murders. And even though there are only a few people I call friends, I'd do most anything to keep their trust. So when a judge asks me to help investigate a missing college kid, I'm down for it. No questions asked. No problem. But in this dark world, things are never easy and a favor is never just a favor. Turns out, politicians don't like being murder suspects. And it's bad to anger someone with more power than you. I thought I had nothing to lose.... I was wrong.</p>";
