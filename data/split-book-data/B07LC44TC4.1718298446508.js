When I finally connect the cases together, a specialist is called in - though, what he’s a specialist of is beyond me.</p> <p>When the chief assigns him as my new partner for the case, I can’t help but groan on the inside. Why of all people would I be assigned to Ailin Ellwood? The man is a disaster waiting to happen and a jerk to boot. A sexy jerk, but a jerk nonetheless.</p> <p>What will Sebastian think when he discovers Ailin’s specialty?
