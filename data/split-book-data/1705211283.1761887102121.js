window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eddie Hunter has discovered that he loves building. Creating things with his own hands satisfies him. Fortunately, his job in the game <i>Light Online</i> allows for that. It also requires that he do all the other things the rest of the players in the game do, so he can't just build.</p> <p>Balancing his time between adventuring and building would be easy if it didn't seem like there were always 27 more things he felt he should be doing at the same time.</p> <p>To make matters worse, there's good evidence supporting a fellow player's theory that Eddie's efforts to increase the settlement level of the Meadowlands cause the game to add new content in the area. So now Eddie has even more things to add to what he's already doing.</p>";
