A nightmare he can’t escape.</b></p> <p>If Arthur Mallory plays one more steaming pile of garbage disguised as a virtual role-playing game, he might hang up his gaming hat for good. When he discovers the new “deep dive” game Worlds Unbound, he decides it might be worth a try. If it sucks, he'll just return it the next day and cancel the financing.</p> <p>The game is everything he could have wanted, even without elves or dwarves or character creation. The magic system has him hooked.</p> <p>He’s willing to overlook the mangled sleep schedule and crippling nightmares if it means feeling that power running through his veins. But when an accident leaves his headset broken, he realizes he might be cut off from the magic - and the game - for good.</p> <p>He’s not going to let that happen.</p>";
