The best hope for humanity to conquer the World Dungeon and survive the Genesis game.</p> <p>By his own actions, Seraph has become a pariah, ostracized and rejected by the few humans inside the World Dungeon. Far removed from the savior, he was tasked to become. His mission to bring humanity to the Altar of the End and save them from Wormwood is endangered by the hate of the Elves of Hometown toward him and the distrust of other people.</p> <p><b>The past has changed.</b></p> <p>Seraph has one hope, a hope to secure a prime Guild Hall for the upcoming influx of people into the dungeon. But, short of allies and desperate for survival, Seraph is forced to enter the second floor of the World Dungeon alone. Never forgetting that failure means the doom of humanity, and for Seraph to save the world, no method is off the table. No price is too great.</p>";
