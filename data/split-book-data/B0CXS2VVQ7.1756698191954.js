window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>[Last time in Multiverse Z!] Overpowered adventurer versus overpowered dungeon.</b></p> <p>Despite the heavy gold bounty on his head, Joey's on the war path to greatness and rising like a star. He has millions of livestream viewers watching him solo an entire dungeon during an apocalypse where the multiverse system integrates whole universes and initiates countless humans to its game-like realms of limitless magic.</p> <p>No problem with Joey. He has skill upgrade attachments to work on. His shadow, necromancy, and dragon magic are growing stronger. There's high-level loot to snatch from slain dungeon bosses. And a cultivation core to develop. Oh, yeah, that's a thing.</p> <p>Joey unlocks a big multiverse secret for a second magic system that works with his great adventurer profileâ€”the cultivation of fate. That's two magic systems for the price of one Shade Dragon Rogue.</p> <p>And he's got a friendly mentor to help him, too. Good guy. Loves to cook, teach nerdy magic stuff, and stop time with a snap of his fingers. That's a very powerful and mysterious mentor to have, alright.</p> <p>This is where the Rogue Ascension series remixes inspirations from He Who Fights With Monsters, Dungeon Crawler Carl, and Primal Hunter. Listen now to enjoy this Apocalypse Isekai with a strong Progression LitRPG and Cultivation System.</p> <p>[Welcome back to Multiverse Z!]</p> <p>[Now let's continue the show.]</p>";
