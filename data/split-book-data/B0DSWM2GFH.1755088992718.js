window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Thaden is built for running dungeons solo, but in order to progress past his current Level, he’s going to have to find some friends rather quickly…</b><br> <br> After resolving all the pending SPECIAL Quests that had been plaguing him, Thaden is finally ready to evolve his Class, where he can then continue to Level-up past his current limit. Unfortunately, his current Evolution Assignment is proving to be a bit more difficult than his last one, as it requires him to complete one of the new Intermediate dungeons with a full Raid Party of at least 100 people without any casualties. Throwing money at the problem might’ve worked in the past, but now there’s a complication that makes such a prospect nearly impossible.<br> <br> The rise of the Contender Guilds.<br> <br> Thaden has had his run-ins with the Guilds in the past, of course, but while he had been away for a while, the Assimilation System has embraced these Guilds and incorporated them into its mechanics, legitimizing them past the relatively loose groups of Contenders they were before and making them official organizations – with specific Quests to go along with them. With Guild Quests including the completion of Intermediate dungeons and a Ranking system with ongoing awards, the competition is fierce – and no one is willing to risk their Ranking by taking someone not affiliated with their Guild along.<br> <br> With these obstacles in place, Thaden struggles to find a Guild willing to accept him as a member, even if only temporarily. This is proving harder than it should be, as while his Class is undoubtedly powerful, information about it and the detrimental drawbacks it enforces on any party he participates in is now widely known.<br> <br> Will he be able to find a Guild inclined to giving him a chance, or will this unaffiliated healer be stuck at his current Level, unable to progress any further?</p>";
