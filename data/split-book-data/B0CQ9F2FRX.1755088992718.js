window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Alexander Lawrence is bored.</b></p> <p>At twenty-seven, his life is an endless loop of painting and teaching—and lots of mind-numbing sex to distract himself from the fact he's trapped in a gilded cage of his mother's making. That is until his best friend goes back to the Fae realm, leaving a seven-foot hunk of grumping gorgeousness to act as Alex's bodyguard, and he suddenly finds himself totally uninterested in anyone else. It's challenging pursuing a guy who seems to hate his guts, knowing it might well end in disaster, but Alex never could resist the thrill of the chase.</p> <p>Teighan Haryk is the half-blood son of a King and a war-hardened Fae Captain to boot. Babysitting humans isn't part of his resume. But he made a promise to watch over Alex—and he never goes back on his word—so for the time being, he's stuck guarding the insufferable artist with the smart mouth and pretty eyes. It's infuriating, but he's oddly enthralled by the creature, and after learning that the boy's life isn't as easy as he assumed, his protective streak awakens. Teighan's resolve is tested to its limit, and despite his efforts to stay indifferent, he's forced to admit that he may have met his perfect match.</p> <p>Alex struggles to deal with his issues while Teighan tries to pretend his feelings don't exist. Their chemistry is scorching, but there's no way their attraction will ever be more than physical.</p> <p>Will it?</p> <p><i>Teighan</i> is an MM paranormal romance with spice, size difference, and soulmates. It features a sunshine human using flirting in place of therapy and a surly Fae whose plans for a peaceful life take a mate-shaped detour. <i>Teighan</i> is second in the Veiled City series, which is best enjoyed in order due to the overarching plot. Each book focuses on its own pair and their HEA.</p>";
