window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a mythical world full of deities and monsters, a young warrior proves his mettle in battle, forging his legend on a quest for godhood.</b></p> <p>During his brief time in the realm of Theos, Luke has faced supernatural dangers and acquired magical abilities beyond imagination. Guided by the God Seed—an ancient artifact bonded to his soul—he walks among champions and the divine. But despite his extraordinary talents and loyal allies, he wears a mask that alters his appearance so those who seek the God Seed cannot find him and extract it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, war rages on the island that is Luke's new home. The Rebel, Tyrisa of Peles, has ruthlessly slaughtered Emperor Cyzicus's loved ones. Joining Heracles in battle, Luke conjures all the magic at his command to protect and defend Cyzicus's people. Within him, the God Seed insists he deliver the killing blow in order to absorb Tyrisa's incredible power. And he will need all the power he can wield for the contest that awaits him . . .</p> <p>The god Hephaestus is hosting the tournament of Olympus, an opportunity for the brave and the bold to claim glory and get a step closer to divinity. The competition will be fierce, the prizes otherworldly. Cyzicus wants Luke to participate in the games, as does the God Seed. But amongst the competitors are those who believe his disguised face marks him as a child of Poseidon, as well as his own friends, who find his personality and actions familiar. Should his identity be revealed, Luke will be at the mercy—and the wrath—of the gods.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 850,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
