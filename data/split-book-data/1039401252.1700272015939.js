And Micah Case holds the key.</p> <p>Janus is now allied with Akkadia's new premier, Asher Dent, and the man is not as peace-loving as he might seem. It's going to be up to Micah Case and Task Force Blue to prevent Dent from achieving that which he wants most: total space supremacy over all the settled worlds.</p> <p>Includes <i>Operation Cobalt</i>, a bonus novella from the Biogenesis Wars series.</p>";
