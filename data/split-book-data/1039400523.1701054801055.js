Laying to rest many of their brother warriors, they return to the Third Directorate, battered, bruised, and weary of soul.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the world turns, and new challenges press. Cinder must set aside his grief, especially when granted a task by Anya Aruyen, the elven princess with whom he shares an inexplicable bond. She urges him to further master his skills as a warrior and become worthy of fighting at her side.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others have also taken note of Cinder. His name is spoken in the high halls of elven palaces. The empress watches him, wondering at his unmatched abilities. So, too, do the dwarves. They fear Cinder, worrying that he is the embodiment of their darkest prophecies. And in the distant north, shadows gather. They whisper of their fallen god, Shet, dead 3,000 years now. Whispering of his rebirth.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when the prophecies speak conflicting portents and none can decipher the truth, what path can even a consummate warrior take?</p>";
