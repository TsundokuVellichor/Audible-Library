Everyone must choose a Class, and Quest directives compel them to climb the leaderboards for categories like highest level… and most kills of other people.</p> <p>Jordan isn’t anyone special before the Merging, but the new start equalizes the playing field. He must exploit his versatile class to overcome powerful monsters and opportunistic strangers who kill people as a quick path to power.</p> <p>He’ll find that the greatest threat may not be monsters or humans but hostile alien species added in the Merging. Sharing the leaderboards and the same final prize, they will stop at nothing to wipe out the competition.</p> <p>For Jordan, surviving isn’t enough. The System promises unfathomable power to those who embrace it and distinguish themselves. To do so requires more than personal strength. Jordan must establish dominion over the new world, defending his territory and expanding it so that he alone reigns above all.</p> <p>With the power of multitasking and a summonable army, how hard can it be?</p> <p>Lord of EXP Farming is a popular serialized novel on Royal Road with thousands of followers and over half a million views.
