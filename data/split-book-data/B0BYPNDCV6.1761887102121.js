The world didn't seem to care like it should, and just as he was getting back on his feet, bizarre monsters from other worlds began to invade, terrorizing Earth.</p> <p>A lesser man would have wanted to run away from it all. Jason picked up a sword and started beating the hell out of things.</p> <p>His newfound powers have made him one of the most effective weapons against the Outsiders, causing the military and the public to rely on him more and more. As if that wasn't enough, Jason gets contacted by the godlike voices that seemingly kidnapped Rob, offering him a deal: fulfill these conditions, and you'll find out what happened to Rob.</p> <p>It's a bad deal and a bad bet. The game is stacked against him. Jason intends to win it anyway—because, in the end, there's no other choice.</p> <p>An Outcast in Another World is a LitRPG adventure series with elements of fantasy, isekai, progression, and weak-to-strong. Jason's side story focuses on the world that Rob left behind after being isekai'd. Fight scenes are high-octane duels that involve creative decision-making on Jason's part.</p>";
