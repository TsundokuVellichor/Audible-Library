He'll explore an ancient temple, face off against monster hordes, and fight an organization of haters. He'll search for lost dungeons and overcome devilish mysteries while being chased by thousands of adventurers.</p> <p>This may lead to Joey's evolution, where he'll gain more shady dragon magic and new skill upgrades.
