window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The final battle looms. On one front, the god of hatred, Vill, leads a horde of undead occupying the Erantian borders, threatening to overrun the orcish steppe. On another, the dark god Rakot aims to break out of Limbh. But even those threats pale before the one coming from the East: three ancient beasts set on wiping out all living beings. </p> <p>The AI systems are in death throes as the Realm of Arkon seems less and less like a game. The standard behavioral algorithms of mobs and NPCs are long in the past. Gone are the simple quests and comical enemies. If you want to win, to grow stronger, or at least to survive, you must evolve along with this merciless world. </p> <p>Krian must fight for his freedom, for his friends, and for the future of the world he now calls home. And as the finale draws near at breaking speed, a Black Flame blazes in the Steppe, growing ever brighter....</p>";
