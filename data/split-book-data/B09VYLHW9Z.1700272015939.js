After a hundred floors filled with unique challenges, a prize awaits - a dragon's egg.</p> <p>To Tem, the Dragon's Tower seems simple from his distant farmland on the frontier. The harsh truth of the situation involves politics, personal sacrifices, and unfathomable struggles to keep advancing. The fate of world rests in the hands of the brave, and Tem is not one to back down from a fight.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This audiobook has LitRPG stats. It involves gear, attributes, and leveling up.
