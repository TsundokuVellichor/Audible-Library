window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A former mercenary turned blind priest, Ash is running from his amoral past - a victim of a power-hungry corporation, Titanus, which used him for mysterious experiments, discarding him when he lost his sight.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through its experimentation, Titanus unwittingly created a dark mirror world called Shade, a place where no human can survive - except for Ash. By opening a rift, Ash can escape into Shade, where his vision is restored, his wounds heal more quickly, and, if necessary, he can drag his attackers in with him, turning them to dust.&nbsp;</p> <p>While attempting to implement a global teleportation system, Titanus makes a grave error and opens several dangerous rifts, which threaten to tear the planet apart. Believing Ash to be the only one able to close them, Titanus exploits those Ash cares about most to coerce him into cooperating.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the creatures they have inadvertently released from Shade will be the least of their worries.</p>";
