He was only away for half a year, but close to a decade has passed for his people.</p> <p>New ruling structures have formed. The pack's alliance has shifted, and the Woodson Fort has flourished. The council he gathered to advise him has now replaced his position as ruler. Flint might have started it all, but now he might as well be an outsider.</p> <p>This loss is the least of Flint's concerns. Oth, the Devourer of Worlds, haunts Flint's dreams. The Vikings and draugr that worship him need blood and slaves to feed their war machine, and his home is in their path. There has never been a greater need for the Champion of Equilibrium, and it's up to Flint to find them.</p> <p>The Disk needs unity, but first, he must convince the council and the other ruling powers of the coming threat. Hopefully, his new status as a druid will help him. Unfortunately, his warnings and haggard state make him far too much like a raving loon.</p> <p>This is the fourth and final book in the Houndsman series. Have you been dreaming of a LitRPG with kingdom-building, flashy skills, and evolving dogs? Well, you just found it.</p>";
