window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the depths of the Destruction Realm, Ruin Val’dor rises from the ashes of his former life, bound to a destiny of chaos and power. Once Ruwen Starfield, he now wields the legacy of a noble bloodline—a path that leads straight into the heart of the Realm’s deepest secrets. Desperate to reclaim his humanity, Ruin must unravel the mysteries of his transformation and find a way back to who he once was.</p> <p>But the Destruction Realm has its own plans. As Ruin battles to master the powers thrust upon him, an ancient enemy manipulates the very fabric of magic, threatening to shatter the universe. To stop them, Ruin must navigate the Destruction Realm towers, unlock forgotten paths, and unite forces he barely understands—all while holding onto the hope that his humanity can still be restored.</p> <p>As time runs out and enemies converge, Ruin faces the ultimate question: will his desire to reclaim his human form cost him the universe he’s sworn to protect? Or will he embrace his new identity to confront a destiny, and enemies, far greater than himself.</p> <p>Book 11 of the <i>Divine Apostasy</i> series, <b>Zealot's Eleventh Crusade</b> examines the complex relationships between loyalty, identity, and the relentless pursuit of balance. The stakes have never been higher, and the cost of failure is not just Ruin’s life—but the collapse of existence itself.</p>";
