window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A one-woman war machine wreaks havoc while exploring her all-too-human heart in the final installment of this fight-filled LitRPG adventure series.</b></p> <p>Accidentally banished to an alternate reality by her own hand, weapon-heavy cyborg NSLICE-00P has had to adapt to her new environment in order to survive. But she's also evolved to <i>thrive</i> as less of a \"kill everything\" high-tech nightmare and more of a \"try to be nice before killing everything\" young lady capable of actual emotion, becoming the magic-wielding force for good known as Her Majesty Seero, queen of the Dobhar and true friend of the Empire. And the Empire needs a friend like her more than ever . . .</p> <p>Because every corner of the land is in chaos. The higher echelons of power have been corrupted, and the Eastern Court is under attack by the Empire of the Sun, aided by the twisted Heralds of the New Dawn cultists. Not to mention, they've just unleashed a host of nightmarish creatures using every dungeon not under Seero's control and protection. Civilization itself teeters on the edge of doom.</p> <p>Now, along with her loyal cadre of friends and fighters, she'll have to wage a war unlike any ever imagined. The enemy threatens to overwhelm the Empire with raw, unrelenting darkness, but for the now-legendary Seero, darkness is just an opportunity to do what she does best: <i>light 'em</i> <i>up</i>.</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
