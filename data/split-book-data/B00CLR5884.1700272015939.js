window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of <i>The Iron Druid Chronicles</i> comes a rollicking, all-new urban-fantasy adventure featuring Atticus O’Sullivan. Atticus has a history of messing with the gods, and in this original novella, he’ll have to outfox a deity at her own deadly cat-and-mouse game.</b> </p> <p>When he’s not vanquishing villainous gods or dodging demons, 2,000-year-old Druid Atticus O’Sullivan can be found behind the counter of Third Eye Books and Herbs in modern-day Tempe, Arizona, literally minding his own business. But when an evil sorcerer - and amateur shoplifter - snatches an ancient Egyptian tome of black magic, <i>The Grimoire of the Lamb,</i> Atticus is not sheepish about pursuing him to the ends of the earth...or at least to the Land of the Pharaohs. </p> <p>Unfortunately Atticus already has enemies in Egypt - including cat goddess Bast, who wants her own book of mischief back from the Druid. In the streets of Cairo, she sends a feline phalanx after Atticus and his Irish wolfhound, Oberon. With fur still flying, Atticus must locate the sorcerer’s secret lair - where he will face killer crocodiles, spooky sarcophagi, and an ancient evil Egyptian who’s determined to order the sacrificial lamb special tonight. </p> <p><b>Includes a bonus recording of the short story \"Clan Rathskellar\"!</b></p>";
