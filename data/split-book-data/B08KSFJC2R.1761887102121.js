He and his friends Andre, Taylor, and Zed have known each other forever, and swear that nothing will ever tear apart their friendship.</p> <p>Then the Royal Decree comes. With the Dynasty of Dogs invading, and strange monsters appearing in the Hollow Kingdom, a draft has been implemented. Everyone 17 or older is required to be tested for \"Potential\".
