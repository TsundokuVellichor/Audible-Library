window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Daniel's (updated) guide to early retirement, version 2.0:</p> <ol> <li>Intercept illegal money transfer from mafia boss. (Complete success. Except for the part where I was discovered and almost caught.) </li> <li>Hide out in super-exclusive full immersion virtual reality game until the heat is off. (Doing fine so far. They may have figured out that I’m in-game. Still, it’s a huge game, so no problem, right?) </li> <li>Roll a bard. Max out charisma. Live it up. (Two out of three ain’t bad. We’re just postponing the \"live it up\" part a bit.) </li> <li>Profit. (Still almost two years to go for that. Think happy thoughts!)</li> </ol> <p>He could have been way worse off. Sure, Daniel was stuck in-game as the local bard of a quaint village, but people were nice, the quests juicy, and the lore intriguing. Even so, with the mob on the look-out, Daniel would soon find himself sorely tested to avoid detection.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer: </b>Still no harems in this series, even with a bard MC. Go figure. We’re going light on the cursing and less light on the puns. You were warned.</p>";
