A moot point, since this one definitely is - he knows that much from bitter experience.</p> <p>So, when his vampire ex-coworker dumps Albigard of the Unseelie on Len's doorstep, he gives her two hours to find a better hiding place for the Fae fugitive before tossing him straight to the curb with the rest of the garbage.</p> <p>He should have known better, of course. Because if there's one thing Len's learned since being thrown into the deep end of the seedy paranormal underworld, it's that nothing is ever so simple.</p> <p>Now he's on the run from a cataclysmic primal force trying to tear its way into the human realm, stuck with an annoying bastard who already knows way too much about the inside of Len's messed-up head. The first time he met Albigard, Len punched the Fae in his too-perfect face. This time, they'll have to learn to work together - or risk having their souls torn apart and consigned to the void, with the rest of humanity facing the same fate soon after.</p> <p>The Wild Hunt has slipped its chains.<br> Darkness is coming for the world.</p> <p>Forsaken Fae is a slow-burn M/M urban fantasy trilogy.
