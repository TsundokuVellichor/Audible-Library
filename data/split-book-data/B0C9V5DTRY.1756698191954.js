window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Corruption. Power struggle. Malevolent deities.</p> <p>All this is topped off by a mysterious golden tower that appeared overnight, drawing adventurers from far and wide. Still recovering from the events of Transposition and struggling with his nature, Matt sets out to rescue his best friend from the clutches of the mysterious organization that kidnapped him. He’ll need every trick in the Rogue’s playbook to stay ahead of the game, using infiltration, cunning, and his unique Ordinator ability to outthink and outmaneuver stronger and better-connected foes.</p> <p>With both new players and the remaining fragments of government in pursuit, playing both sides comes with the territory, and leaning into his alternate identity’s villainous image will be key. Of course, there’s the obvious question: How long can you play the villain before you become one?</p> <p>Book two of a LitRPG apocalypse series set in the real world, where the price of failure is death, and the prize for winning is beyond Matt's wildest dreams.</p>";
