Soon, the two sides will clash in the Challenge of Donnyton.</b></p> <p>As both make their preparations, the goals of the two are very different. Randidly wants to show how they cannot rest on their laurels, how under the System, there will always be one more monster, one more Calamity, one more \"Creature\" watching the development of their planet and plotting how to extract everything of value.</p> <p>He witnessed the brutality of the Second Calamity on Tellus and does not want his own world to be so scarred.</p> <p>Yet on the other side of the challenge, the people of Earth want to send a different message: Randidly Ghosthound, you do not need to carry this burden alone. Chasing his shadow, the people of Earth have grown strong.</p> <p>In the wake of the challenge, Randidly will head into a Dungeon to train. There, he will discover clues of how ancient the struggle to escape the Calamities truly is.</p> <p>And he will also unearth a darkness that can wound even the System itself...</p>";
