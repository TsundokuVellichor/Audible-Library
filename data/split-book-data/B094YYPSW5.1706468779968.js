window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Smart men quit while they’re ahead - they lay low and hope disaster blows on by them. Not me. Especially when disaster seems to follow me and my soulmate Havoc, a demon I bound to me 300 years ago with my magic.&nbsp;</p> <p>The dark mage Geoff is back from the dead and creating chaos by devouring the hearts of people with magical abilities, giving him overwhelming power as his followers grow. And since I’m one of the strongest mages alive and am leading the resistance against him, he’s coming for me next. Oh, and it might have something to do with the fact that I was also the one who originally killed him. But you can’t blame me; the guy needed to die.&nbsp;</p> <p>Havoc and I, along with our unlikely band of...(I don’t want to say heroes, I can’t give them that much credit) annoyances will stop at nothing to end the destruction. It doesn’t hurt that there’s a sexy demon by my side every step of the way. For the first time in 300 years, I’m finally with the person meant for me, and I will do anything to keep from losing him.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Familiar Beginnings is a 63k word sequel to Happy Endings. Contains a powerful mage who just wants to be left in peace, a mysterious curly-haired troublemaker, gargoyles that are literally dumber than stone, a river trip that doesn’t feel at all like a vacation, and a “cat” with some unusual features and deadly claws.</i></p>";
