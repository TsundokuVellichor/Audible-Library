Armed with beam weaponry against unreasonable rats, he’s making impressive progress on the Eternia Beta Run. Thanks in part to the Dwarves and their relentless cheers to \"Push...the...button!\" There are a few final challenges that loom large on his path to triumph: the frozen continental storm, Fuyu No Arashi; the Matchless Gaston, and the final boss...Pag!</p> <p>Artorian will overcome these obstacles with style! First, he must strike a pose, transforming into a muscle-grandpa of epic proportions—a Swole-torian, a Gains-torian, Sir Lift-orian, the Beefcake, Mr. Tough Love! Second, he must don his most wicked grin, his finest armor, and play the part of the villain with gusto.</p> <p>Welcome to the dawn of the Glorious Overkill, and the advent of Dreadshine, the Nightmare Fuel.</p>";
