window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Having survived the first wave of invading players, Oren now seeks to strengthen his clan. With the Breeder's Den destroyed and most of Goblin's Gorge's resources devoted to rebuilding, his best hope lies in creating an army of golems. But for that, he needs Viridium, a rare metal that can only be obtained from hobgoblin towns, where Oren and his clan of goblins are viewed as nothing more than potential slaves. To make his way in the game, and to defeat his former guild, Oren's ingenuity alone will not be enough. He will need to conquer his deepest fears and tap into his inner monster. </p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production: </p> <p>Jeff Hays - Narration, Music, Sound Design </p> <p>Laurie Catherine Winkel - Raystia, Yulli </p> <p>Annie Ellicott - Misa, Lolo, Duladeen </p> <p>Dalton Lynne - Proofing, Editing </p> <p>Ahmed Mahmoud - Production, Editing, Mastering, Music, Sound Design</p>";
