window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"I've awakened in a stone box about the size of a large coffin.... I'm filthy, everything aches, and, by the various so-called gods, I smell awful. I've woken up in worse places. Hmm. What does that say about my life choices?\" (Eric, amateur magician, part-time vampire, and accidental king) </p> <p>It's not easy being king. Especially when you've got an allergy to sunrise and sunset, a fire goddess for a mother-in-law, demonic adversaries, random assassins, and a basement full of insecurities to cope with. Add to that his daughter, the fire priestess/princess; a couple of lightly deranged professional magicians; a whole city full of wizards; and enough squabbling princes to resemble a kindergarten argument. It's enough to make a man want to just go home. Luckily for Eric, he has the world's fastest pet rock, a smart-mouthed sword, and a horse that not only understands him but likes him anyway. </p>";
