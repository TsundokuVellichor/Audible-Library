window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young warrior risks his life and soul to develop his arcane knowledge—and destructive power—in this dark fantasy adventure.</b></p> <p>Zeke Blackwood wields immeasurable power. A half-human, half-demon Cambion, he has fought his way through the Eternal Realm, becoming a legend in the process. A liberator of slaves and the leader of an army of loyal kobolds, he reluctantly takes on the responsibility of protecting those who've sworn to fight at his side, even as his other allies remain lost to him.</p> <p>Talia Nightingale has joined her undead brethren in the Deathguard, investigating a series of murders most foul. The alchemist Tucker lives among the Kirran, a race of dragonkin in desperate need of a potion to cure a wicked curse. And Abby, the woman Zeke once loved and who betrayed them all, has found purpose as the inquisitor for the Radiant Host, a cult of Sun Goddess worshippers seeking to cleanse the land of the impure.</p> <p>But Zeke's closest companions are soul-bonded to him: the bearkin Pudge and the demonic mind spirit Eveline. One shares his feelings; the other reads his thoughts. But neither influences him as much as his dual nature, divided between empathy for others and an insatiable lust for dominion. And with every monster he slays, the more power he accrues, forcing him to confront the darkness that lies in own heart . . .</p> <p><b>The seventh volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
