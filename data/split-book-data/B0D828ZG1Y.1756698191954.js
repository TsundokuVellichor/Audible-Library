BUT HE HADN'T HEARD OF RIYRIA.</p> <p>When a master-craftsmen dwarf is fired, he threatens retaliation. The rogues-for-hire known as Riyria are commissioned to find and stop him. Traveling to the paradise resort of Tur Del Fur, the two are granted a lavish allowance that, along with the easy job, promises to turn the trip into a vacation.</p> <p>Everything would have been perfect except that the disgruntled employeeâ€™s last name is Berling and the target of his wrath is the legendary towers of Drumindor.</p> <p>It's been more than five years since the last adventure with Royce Melborn (a cynical ex-assassin) and Hadrian Blackwater (an idealistic ex-mercenary), a pair whose bonds of friendship are bound with blood. This is the 20th novel based in the world of Elan and the fifth in the Riyria Chronicle series.</p>";
