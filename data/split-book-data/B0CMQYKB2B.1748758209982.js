window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Amanecida Gate is open. Blessed fresh air! Why are there no people?</b></p> <p>Artorian's stroll onto Earth is cut short by a dagger in the back. Dealing with an unjust loss, he's torn between mourning what was lost and plotting a deviously calculated revenge. An eye for an eye, a stab for a stab. It's time to roll up those sleeves, whip out the master plan, and get down to crafting the narrative.&nbsp;</p> <p>Preparations must be made to return all that is Cultivator, to a world neither ready nor adapted for them, with a status quo that not everyone is happy with. The factions of old bristle and rise. Hidden enemies reveal themselves. Odin laughs, and brings a final surprise. Grandpa, the Grand Architect, will accomplish an impossible, single-minded goal.</p> <p>Thunder will die, and Apollo will kick him out of the sky.</p>";
