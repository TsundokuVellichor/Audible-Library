window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>War never changes, as even among the Ancients, ancient grudges spark revolution.</b></p> <p>The final moments of the journey in Ancient Greece sets the stage for a revolution ready to explode faster than a poorly brewed potion. The Old Guild and Asguardian Remnants are itching for a comeback tour. Led by Odin's feathered spies, Huginn and Muninn, they’re all set to hunt Artorian down—this time for good. They're betting their last shiny coin on vengeance, aiming to turn Artorian's dream of a New World into a nightmare—permanently.</p> <p>Artorian, now a mere mortal cut off from the ever-revival of the Seed Cores, finds himself playing on hardcore mode. With no respawns in sight, he's gearing up for a showdown that's less about divine intervention and more about divine invention. His weapon of choice? The Luminous Gatling—part disco ball, part harbinger of doom—ready to light up the night sky with a feather-picking light show.</p> <p>As the twilight of Cal looms, it's clear that the old guard isn't going down without a saga-worthy fight.</p>";
