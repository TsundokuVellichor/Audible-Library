Everyone wanted in, few were invited to play. </p> <p>Hundreds of millions of dollars were won and lost at her table. Molly's game became the game for those in the know - celebrities, business moguls, and millionaires. Molly staged her games in palatial suites with beautiful views and exquisite amenities. She flew privately, dined at exclusive restaurants, hobnobbed with the heads of Hollywood studios, was courted by handsome leading men, and was privy to the world's most delicious gossip, until it all came crashing down around her. </p> <p><i>Molly's Game</i> is a behind the scenes look at Molly's game, the life she created, the life she lost, and what she learned in the process.</p>";
