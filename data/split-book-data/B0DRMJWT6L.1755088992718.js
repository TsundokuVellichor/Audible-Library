All his knowledge of metallurgy, engraving, and the System will shape this grand project. And if his theory proves true, the result will be much more alchemy than mechanism.</p> <p>While Randidly Ghosthound has plans, so does the Nexus. During his next Judgement, an extra consequence is applied; he is kidnapped from Earth and taken to the outer reaches of the Nexus proper. There, he must fight against the endless horde of Nether Beasts that covet the resources of the Nexus.</p> <p>Yet the powers of the Nexus did not spring this trap intending for him to survive. Not only is he conscripted, but his body is held ransom; to avoid execution, he must send images, conjured of Aether, out onto the battlefield in his place.</p> <p>Nether is the most dangerous substance Randidly Ghosthound has encountered. And now his aspect of the Grim Chimera must wade in it.</p> <p><b>Book 9 of the hit LitRPG Fantasy series with over 50 Million views on Royal Road.</b></p>";
