window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>WHO AM I?</p> <p>A devastating dungeon break at his sister’s high school is quickly taken care of by Jinwoo...but not before he confirms that magic beasts no longer register him as a human. What’s more, the deceased Byunggu Min sends him a cryptic warning from beyond the grave: Jinwoo’s powers are more frightening than he knows. Left with too many questions and very few answers, his final hope lies in the key to the Cartenon Temple. Jinwoo’s determined to find out who—or what—he’s become, and to do so, he’s prepared to return to where it all began!</p>";
