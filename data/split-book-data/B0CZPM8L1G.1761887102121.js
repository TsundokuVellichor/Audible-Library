They endured the Blight, betrayals, and bombs, barely managing to prevail over the many trials that assailed them. An alliance has been brokered between nations, and for the first time, the Blight seems like it's on the ropes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there's never rest for the weary. It isn't long before they hear news of a brewing war between the Harpies and Dragonkin. Confused and concerned, the newly formed allied coalition heads down to find out what's going on—only to become embroiled in a dark conspiracy that threatens to shake Elatra to its core.</p> <p>As corruption rises in Harpy territory, Rob finds himself surrounded by enemies on all sides. With two leaders, the Blight, and the gods all setting their sights on him, the stakes have never been higher. He has no choice but to fight onward, motivating himself with the knowledge that peace lies at the end of this long, bloody road.</p> <p>If he can hold onto his sanity, that is.</p>";
