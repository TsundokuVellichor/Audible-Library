window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I was summoned to the family estate, I had no idea that my life was about to take a drastic turn. One moment I was good old Arthur, a young man with no real aim in life, the next I was in possession of my first four magical cards, on my way to become a Convoker!</p> <p>But if my grandfather had entrusted this huge responsibility to me, I had to prove worthy. I had to take on the life of an Adventurer and complete our lineage quest—a perilous search and rescue mission in the most treacherous parts of our lands. But first things first, as a new Convoker, I had to start by learning the ropes and discover how to tame the Espers within the cards so they would at least listen to me. That's the only way I would gain any type of power.</p> <p>And the gods know I will need power. It's a huge world out there, full of wonders and strange creatures, but also rife with monsters and mortal dangers. To stay alive, I will need to build my Convoker's deck, with the right mix of spells, minions, and equipment cards.</p> <p>Wish me luck as my journey leads me to duel other Convokers and also infiltrate the lair of some cruel Spider Goddess. But I guess such is the life of a Convoker—live by the cards, die by the cards.</p>";
