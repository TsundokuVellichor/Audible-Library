window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A one-time football fanatic continues his fight to become an all-time legend of the game in the fifth book of this hard-hitting, humorous sports LitRPG.</b></p> <p>Max Best was on a roll. After climbing the ranks at Chester FC with his burning desire, innate talent, and the \"curse\" of a sentient heads-up display with knowledge of all things footie, he was named the club's electrifying new director of football. Seizing the opportunity, he saved the day and led the team out of relegation. But that's when someone tried to murder him . . .</p> <p>Waking up in the hospital, Max is barely alive, with a crack in his skull—and without his curse, thanks to Old Nick, the creepy entity who gave it to him in the first place. Nick thinks Max needs some time to recover and repair as well as learn some control of his own, because Max's most pressing challenges are about to come at him from all sides. He'll need to navigate his responsibilities to his players, staff, and girlfriend, not to mention the league bosses and crazed public that want his head on either a golden bust or a silver platter.</p> <p>And without his curse to guide him, for once Max will have to depend on one thing alone to get him through this mess: himself.</p> <p><b>The fifth volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 800,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
