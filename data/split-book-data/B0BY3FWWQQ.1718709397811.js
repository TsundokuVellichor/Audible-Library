window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To forget and live, or to live and fight?</b></p> <p><b>The Marshal</b>. Melvin Kaur is a nobleman, a magician, and a high-ranking cog in the Clockwork Brigade working out of Istal. His well-established spot in high society is a grand cover for the smuggling his family oversees. But when a handoff goes wrong, and Melvin is forced to flee through the night with his charges, he finds unexpected help from an endearing man in the unlikeliest of places.<br> <br> <b>The Toy Maker</b>. Ezra Wren is trying to keep his family’s business in the black and the banks at bay, but the numbers in his ledger do not lie. Debt bondage is a very real threat he will soon have to face, and that was before a bloodied nobleman broke into his toy shop in the dead of night. Despite the risk, Ezra can’t turn away those in need, and finds himself saying yes to a nobleman’s plea and losing his heart in the process when he can ill afford to lose anything.</p> <p><i>Previously released through Prolific Works in 2022.
