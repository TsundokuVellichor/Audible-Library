So why is everything falling apart? Literally.</p> <p>With the help of allies old and new, Auric thwarted Salvo’s plan and narrowly avoided cataclysm. But in the wake of that confrontation, something went very, very wrong.</p> <p>Now everywhere Auric turns he sees that his home, his world, and even the System itself are coming apart at the seams. Entropic gateborn roam the wilds unchecked while rogue storms and freak anomalies spring up seemingly at random. And worse, there’s rumors of something coming in the distance. Something that arrives without warning and leaves only the shattered remnants of reality in its wake.</p> <p>Auric achieved the power he’s always dreamed of, but with Salvo gone, there’s no one left to stand beside him. To figure out why the System’s unraveling. To fight against the oncoming chaos. If he’s going to survive, he’ll have to delve deeper into the inner workings of the System than anyone ever has before—right back to where it all began.</p> <p>Auric Cain found his chance, and if he’s lucky, he might live to regret it.</p>";
