I’ve wanted to ask - to beg - for help, but the spell that’s held me captive wouldn’t allow it.&nbsp;</p> <p>With it out in the open, I’m more determined than ever to break the seal from my chest, so I can truly be free. But what if my seal has something to do with one of the most feared prophecies of the millennium?</p> <p><i>“A broken seal breaks the fragile hold...”&nbsp;</i></p> <p>What does that mean? How am I connected? And why do I find myself so deeply drawn to Julius when I know my viramore, my soulmate, is out there somewhere? It’s not fair to either of us to lead Jules on, but it seems that my vampire companion is fierce in his determination to help me.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Witch’s Blood</i> is the third book in The Ellwood Chronicles and is a continuation of the overall story as we follow Emrys, Julius, Sebastian, and Ailin on their journey.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warning: The story contains explicit material and is intended for mature adults 18 years of age and older.</b></p>";
