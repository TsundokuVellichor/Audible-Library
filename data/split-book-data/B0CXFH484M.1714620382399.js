The Corruption has other ideas. Plans set into motion eons ago are finally clicking into place.</p> <p>The greatest threat this Cycle has seen mounts on the horizon, but the nobles can’t even settle their petty disputes, much less present a united front against the end of the world. In the end, to Damien and Henry, it doesn’t matter. No matter who stands in their way, they refuse to let everything they’ve worked so hard to protect fall to the Corruption.</p> <p>If the Mortal Plane is to continue existing, then there’s only one option.</p> <p>They have to do what even the combined forces of the Void couldn’t–defeat Second once and for all.</p> <p><b>The sixth and final book in the My Best Friend is an Eldritch Horror Series. It's slice-of-life mixed with LitRPG in a magic school setting. A slow build power fantasy from Actus, the bestselling author of Morcster Chef.</b></p>";
