But what I don't expect is to be dragged into the book filled with dark mysteries that leaves me with more questions and a lack of pants. But it's nothing that Havoc and I can't handle. </p> <p>The two of us have proven that our relationship is strong enough that we can face anything life throws at us, so I think we can handle a measly book maybe I mean, so far it may look like were not winning, but that's just because it'd be boring if heroes won immediately. And it's not like we have to fight this battle alone, especially with an awe-inspiring dragon familiar who is forced to face his greatest adversary (a common housecat), a narcissistic angel who comes with a sword that compliments every cut made, a centaur who always manages to look like he's on the set of a cologne commercial, and Etienne (whatever he is). </p> <p>With the demon I love by my side and my found family, we're going to stop this darkness before it spreads. But doing so might unveil some things we never expected.</p>";
