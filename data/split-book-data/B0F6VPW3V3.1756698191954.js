But there's no rest to be had with what's ahead: the FA Cup.</p> <p>Now, they're playing against big-money teams with big talent and even <i>bigger</i> attitudes. And the elite aren't about to let some smart-aleck, fast-talking upstart and his underdog lads make the powerhouse clubs look like fools. Unfortunately for them, that's precisely what Max lives for. Pushing himself and his team to the limits, he's out to prove that Chester has earned everything they've got.</p> <p>But success on the field can't protect Max from a surprise attack that takes things to an entirely new low. With brutally biased press jackals digging up some serious dirt, Max's past, personal life, and very integrity are under threat. Someone out there wants him not just damaged but destroyed. If he's going to survive this season, he'll have to play low-block defence like never before—and wait for one perfect moment to take one perfect shot at a win.</p> <p><b>The sixth volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 800,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
