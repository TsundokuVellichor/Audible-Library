window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He always dreamed of becoming a Champion. But finding a mythical sword could cut his life short....</b></p> <p>Finn Featherstone longs to trade in his paintbrush for a legendary Bizarre Blade. One day, after heroically rescuing a young girl and coming face-to-face with his sword-fighting idol, he is shocked to learn he is being drafted as a foot soldier. A few days later the army caravan he marches with is attacked by a pack of saber-toothed tigers. While trying to survive, Finn finds himself crashing through the ice where he mistakenly discovers a magical Blade of his very own. </p> <p>Introduced to a world of Champions jealous of his random find, Finn struggles to master his sword’s sludge-spitting bad attitude. Surrounded by dubious allies, he must somehow find the courage to battle the vicious meat-eating dinosaurs that roam the land as well as trying to survive the freezing elements. And when a traitor takes down Finn’s fellow Champions, the former painter must tame his angsty weapon in a hurry if he has any hope of winning the fight of his life. </p> <p>Can Finn command his deranged Blade before his dreams of glory come to a bloody end? </p> <p><i>The Jigsaw Blade</i> is the first book in the refreshingly unique Bizarre Blades sword-and-sorcery fantasy series. If you like plucky heroes, wacky humor, and ferocious dinosaurs, then you’ll love Stevie Collier’s swashbuckling tale.</p>";
