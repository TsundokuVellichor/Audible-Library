window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I used to be the greatest Earth Mage in my world. The head of the entire Order of Architects. But the older you get, the more you come to realize that at some point, you need to retire, so that you can have the chance to enjoy a peaceful life and to cede your place to the young, some of whom have already turned two thousand years old . . .</p> <p>So that's what I did. I had everything I could ever want, and even more besides. But I failed to account for one thing: during the course of my long life, I'd accumulated too many enemies, and they had decided to spoil my retirement. So they died along with me. And I hope their deaths were final. But mine was not!</p> <p>I've been reborn in a strange new world, and I now need to start over. I still have all my experience and memories, but what about my power? I've managed to climb to the top once already; I can do it again! And it's crucial that I do so before this world is consumed by the beasts from the Shadow Plane . . .</p>";
