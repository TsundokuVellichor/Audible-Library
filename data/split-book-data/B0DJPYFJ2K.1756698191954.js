How could any one being hold in their hands the key to fate and not succumb to the inevitable corruption of such a thing?</b></p> <p>Arthur Leywin's quest for the power he knows only as Fate becomes even more pressing as his most dangerous foes gain a terrible new power. When the war between the dragons of Epheotus and the basilisks of Alacrya erupts across Dicathen, the people Arthur cares about most find themselves trapped in a clash of deities. The only way to master Fate and protect them, though, is to place them directly in harm's way in the ultimate gambit.</p>";
