window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The threats I've been facing in this world, well, it's like playing whack-a-mole.<br> <br> The local aristocrats are still conspiring to put roadblocks in the path of the ever more powerful Bulatov Family. And then I have the offworlders from another worldâ€”they haven't gone anywhere, either.<br> <br> They're still opening portals and sending through invaders, although, thus far, these attacks have been isolated grabs for loot and prisoners. A portal opens, offworlders dash out, get what they can, and retreat.<br> <br> For me, the offworlders have generally been an irritant and not much more. In contrast, the aristocratic enemies within my new world have consumed far more of my energy. That being said, it looks like now, the offworlders have managed to unite, and take over the city neighboring Arkhangelsk.<br> <br> Does that mean that it is now time for me to turn my attention to ushering out the guests from another world? And will this offworld threat force these local aristocrats to drop their hostilities and band together against our common enemy?<br> <br> Hard to say, but, like usual, I can only really count on myself and my forces.<br> <br> Let's just hope I have what it takes to get the job done!</p>";
