window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The epic conclusion to Keiran: The Eternal Mage!</b></p> <p>It’s been six months since Keiran left his greatest enemy stranded on one of Manoch’s moons, six months of feverish work preparing for the lich’s seemingly inevitable return. Keiran is gathering allies and resources, and working to strengthen himself as much as possible.</p> <p>But when he hits a bottleneck just one step short of finally regaining his full power, never mind solving it before Ammun returns, he’s not sure he’ll be able to solve it, ever. Distractions abound as payments come due for past aid, an order of archmages takes an unhealthy interest in his activities, and friendships begin to fracture under the weight of both Keiran’s responsibilities and his secrets.</p> <p>Can he survive the crushing weight of a lich clad in a moon’s full power bearing down on him, or will he be washed away in the flood?</p> <p>A reincarnated archmage's journey to the peak–perfect for fans of The Beginning After the End, Imperial Wizard, and Birth of the Demonic Sword.</p> <p>A complete, top rated novel on Royal Road with over a million views, now professionally edited and available on Amazon and Audible narrated by John Joseph Rogers and Rylee Kuberra.
