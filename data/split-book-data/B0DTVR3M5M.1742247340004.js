Or all will be lost.\"</p> <p>Rob and Riardin's Rangers have been put in the awkward position of needing to ally with the gods and the Dragon Queen in order to survive. It's an uneasy alliance that only grows more strained as time goes on.

Within the Blights' personal heaven, hell waits for everyone else.</p> <p>And after that... Well. The gods. The Blight. Dragon Queen Ragnavi. Riardin's Rangers.</p> <p>Forces are colliding. Only one faction will survive.</p>";
