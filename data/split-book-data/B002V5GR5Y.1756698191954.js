But now a woman from his old unit has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher using a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators would know. She tells him a terrifying story about the brutal death of a man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day.</p> <p>In a world of bad luck and trouble, when someone targets Jack Reacher and his team, they'd better be ready for what comes right back at them.</p>";
