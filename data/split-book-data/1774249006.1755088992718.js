window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>You don't become the best of the best by staying alive. In the Animus, you get closer to perfection with each death you suffer.</b></p> <p>Kaiden Jericho would rather skip the death part, thank you very much. He wants a little information and perhaps a little payback.</p> <p>He has <i>some </i>information on where an AO stronghold is located. He will need to retrieve vital proof to help get the council to believe the ghost-like organization exists. But can he get the support he needs to make a run at it?</p> <p>Before long, it becomes obvious this isn't a small outpost; more like a major outpost with a lot of support. Kaiden can't wing this operation. He has to start working out his relationships to acquire even a small chance of success. Sasha, Wolfson and Dr. Laurie are helping him...but he needs more.</p> <p>He decides to recruit support from the gangs he knows. The good, the bad, and those he has pissed off. Will they welcome him with open arms or with smiles as they eye him through their weapon sights? Will they <i>at least </i>be non-hostile, or will his friends need to come and help back him up? Will the AO find out that they are under attack in time to prepare? This time, the Ark Academy elite are getting involved. This isn't a game anymore.</p> <p>Join Kaiden as he learns about Nexus, the Animus, and the opportunities that one fight brought him. Never before has helping someone benefit him so much. The future is looking bright...except for the pain.</p>";
