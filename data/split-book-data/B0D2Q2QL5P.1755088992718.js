TIME FOR VICTOR TO PAY.</b><br><br>Assassin-for-hire Victor is in Bucharest, Romania, to kill two targets meeting to exchange stolen intelligence his client wants back. It should be a simple task - until he realises the second of his targets is a former ally. Even for a man of Victor's twisted morality, he's not prepared to kill someone to whom he owes his life. <br><br>To atone for not completing the job, Victor agrees to take on the kind of dangerous assignment he would otherwise avoid.

Even for an elite professional, the job is a tall order - which is why he looks for help from the person whose life he spared in Romania. <br><br>Yet unbeknownst to Victor, the Bucharest contract stepped on the toes of powerful enemies from his past; enemies who now know exactly where to find him . . .";
