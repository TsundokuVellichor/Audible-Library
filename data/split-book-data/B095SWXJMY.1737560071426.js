It’s just a shame he’s found himself with the weakest cards around - goblins! </p> <p>Joined by a fallen goddess, a deposed demon king, and surly local, Gareth sets out into Acamida. In a realm where experience points and levels are very real, Gareth must grow stronger if he intends to have his second life last longer than his first. With monsters around every corner and dungeons beneath his feet, Acamida is a dangerous place. </p> <p>As Gareth finds new cards and grows in power, the rumbles of war stir in the west.
