After struggling to confront his untouchable high school crush at her seventeenth birthday party, Jay adds another interest to his list—Dungeon Crawling in the face of the apocalypse.</p> <p>Jay meets a divine creature who chooses him to become a Champion. Someone with a leveling System, stats, skills, access to other dimensions containing dungeons filled with supernatural loot, and magical powers that’ll alter reality as they know it.</p> <p>Becoming a Champion comes with some issues.

And Jay’s just one young guy trying to have fun with a Class that gets weirder as he evolves and masters his new gravity powers.</p>";
