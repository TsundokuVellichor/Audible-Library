window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Every self-respecting lich has a few hundred phylacteries at a minimum, and Harold wants to check in on a few thousand of his. Rumors reach him that the vicious Mantis Queen has one of them. Naturally, she's at the other end of the region. It's just a casual stroll across the deserted and inhospitable Flaming Steppes. Inhospitable for the living, that is!</p> <p>Fenfang Fang—the Limpet—is taking her job as Harold's very first warlock seriously. The ancient lich figures it's time for his protégé to learn the ins-and-outs of politics by ruling an entire city. Baby steps! Ruling the decrepit city of Yu Xiang looks easy enough. A mudhole at the ass-end of the Empire, ashen dirt that's nearly impossible to farm, waters filled with dangerous beasts, could it be any easier?</p> <p>Of course, rumors reach the Jade Throne that a horrible Lich has taken over the city, and an army of conscripts and lessor cultivators is formed to uproot the great evil.</p> <p>What fantastical sights will Harold see on his trip? Will Limpet be able to keep the city and her head from the army?</p> <p>And the biggest question of all—Will Rem finally get to eat Alex?</p>";
