window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The developmental world of Tarth is under attack by the Adversary…</b><br> <br> After barely surviving an attack by an Adversarial entity, Thaden helps pick up the pieces of the Guild he’d previously joined. Unfortunately, the outlook for Guilded Glory is bleak, as many important Contenders were lost during the unexpected attack, leaving the future of the Guild uncertain at this point in time.<br> <br> Of course, helping to run a Guild was never Thaden’s responsibility, nor did he really want a leadership position when he joined in the first place. Even more, with his recent need to increase his Level, he’s no longer able to participate in Guild activities because he is entirely too powerful to join a Raid Party with his fellow Guild members. As a result, he finds himself largely on his own again, or at least with only his squirrel companion, Sadia, by his side; this result is perfectly fine with Thaden, though, because now he isn’t restrained by any responsibilities. In other words, he can finally use his newly evolved Class to investigate higher-difficulty Intermediate dungeons, challenging himself in ways he never thought possible – and all without worrying about accidentally killing his Raid Party in the process.<br> <br> But the Adversary isn’t quite done yet with Tarth. The entity that Thaden fought previously was just the beginning of a world-wide infiltration; the threat is serious enough that the System decides to fight back with some agents of its own. <br> <br> Unrestrained by the responsibilities of his Guild and with the freedom and power to basically do what he wants, will Thaden choose to face this growing threat? Or will he be pulled into the fight, regardless of his wishes?<br> <br> <i>This story contains an overpowered MC with a normally non-offense-based Class, LitRPG progression mechanics and stats, and isekai/portal fantasy elements. Contains no sexual content or harems.</i></p>";
