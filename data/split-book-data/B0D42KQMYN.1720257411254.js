In a soul-crushing responsibility kind of way. For Matt, joining Earth's last line of defense in a magical realm might just be what he was re-born for.</p> <p>Trading his office cubicle for battlefield chaos of a 4x game world is bonkers. The world map is made out of hexagrams, the units are semi-sentient and his opponents have a head start. As if that wasn't enough, there's no instruction manual for this nightmare. Now, Matt's going to have to figure out how to rule a Magic Kingdom at War or face annihilation along with the world he once knew.</p> <p>Magic Kingdom at War is a tactical, base-building, crunchy LitRPG novella series by Tao Wong, bestselling author of the System Apocalypse, A Thousand Li, Climbing the Ranks, the Hidden Universe and Adventures on Brad series.</p>";
