Loot, pillage, plunder, and sell all the lucre - that's the motto of the Galactogon pirates, and Surgeon is doing his best to join their number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But what is to be done when the enigmatic Uldans do not want to leave our swashbuckler in peace and keep laying new mysteries in his path, distracting him from his main goal? How does one become a formidable buccaneer, the scourge of Galactogon's countless star systems, when an indomitable alien invasion is razing empires all across the galaxy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Time and time again, the game hands Captain Surgeon the Black Spot and time and time again, he refuses to take it. It looks like he will have to work extra hard to realize his dreams of piracy and find the answers to all these mysteries....</p>";
