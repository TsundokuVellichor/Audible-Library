window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Keiran clawed his way from gutter rat to archmage in his first life.</b></p> <p><b>His second was supposed to be easier...</b></p> <p>Keiran of the Night Vale has staved off death for two thousand years. His mind and his magic remain as sharp as ever, but his body is old, worn out, and failing. What he needs is to reincarnate into a new, young body, and he bends his prodigious talents towards doing exactly that.</p> <p>He awakens to find that he’s been reborn in a wasteland where mana has become a scarce resource. Even the internal mana generated by people is stolen away by those who rule them. And without mana, he’s no longer a mage.</p> <p>It will take more than that to stop Keiran. With each passing week, he regains more of his old strength, but can he keep his secrets safely hidden? Standing in his way is his new home’s cult-like nightly mana tithing, a governor with deadly secrets, and a monster-ridden desert.</p> <p>It's a deadly scramble to claim the mana he so desperately needs to survive, but Keiran didn’t become an archmage by accident.</p> <p><b>He’s willing to use every dirty trick and tactic he knows to get there again.</b></p>";
