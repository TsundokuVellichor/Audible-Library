window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An American girl finds her prince in this \"fun and dishy\" (<i>People</i>) royal romance inspired by Prince William and Kate Middleton.</p> <p>American Bex Porter was never one for fairy tales. Her twin sister Lacey was always the romantic, the one who daydreamed of being a princess. But it's adventure-seeking Bex who goes to Oxford and meets dreamy Nick across the hall - and Bex who finds herself accidentally in love with the heir to the British throne.</p> <p>Nick is wonderful, but he comes with unimaginable baggage: A complicated family, hysterical tabloids tracking his every move, and a public that expected its future king to marry a Brit. On the eve of the most talked-about wedding of the century, Bex looks back on how much she's had to give up for true love...and exactly whose heart she may yet have to break.</p>";
