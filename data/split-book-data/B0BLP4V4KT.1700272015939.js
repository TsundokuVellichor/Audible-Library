window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Basil Bohen was asleep when the System arrived and the world changed....</b></p> <p>Dungeons suddenly popped up across the planet, summoning invaders and monsters from alternate realities. Ancient gods slumbering beneath the Earth were woken. And all humans were empowered with Levels and Classes gained by, among other things, killing monsters and other humans.</p> <p>Only a single instruction was provided by the System: <i>“Whoever reaches Level 100 first shall become Earth’s new Overgod.”</i></p> <p>So initiated a worldwide battle royale of epic proportions...which Basil would rather sit out. Choosing the [Tamer] profession, which allows him to speak with his cat, Plato, and other apocalyptic monsters, he'll adopt and train them to fight alongside him and defend his corner of the countryside.</p> <p>After all, why bother fighting the apocalypse when you can tame it?</p> <p><b>Don't miss the start of a new LitRPG series from Maxime J. Durand, best-selling author of </b><b><i>Vainqueur the Dragon </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> The Perfect Run</i></b><b>. Full of equal parts action and laughs, this story is a satirical take on the typical LitRPG apocalypse stories blended with elements of Pokémon and Monster Rancher.</b></p> <p><b>About the series: </b><i>Join Basil as he progresses from level one to 100 all while refusing to play by the rules of the System. Able to recruit monsters to join him with his [Tamer] class, Basil grows a party of unique creatures to keep him company in the end of the world. They'll experience dungeon diving, battles, and building a little slice of forest into a defensible base.</i></p>";
