window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Something went wrong. Something went </b><b><i>very </i></b><b>wrong….</b><br> <br> Against his will, Thaden was transported elsewhere in a big flash of light along with millions of other Humans from Earth, to a place where they would train to become Contenders in a whole new world. Unfortunately for him, something occurred during his transference into the “Training” program, and he was ejected from the whole training process and sent into the open mouth of an active volcano for bodily disposal.<br> <br> Through a miraculous and horrifying series of events, Thaden managed to survive, only to find himself alone in the middle of a dungeon with no clothes, no weapons, and no way to defend himself. Worst of all, the strange new Assimilation System automatically assigned a Class to him without his knowledge, which ended up sticking him with a Support-based Class that has absolutely no offensive capabilities. As an Assistant Healer, none of his spells did any damage and he couldn’t even pick up a weapon to defend himself if he wanted to!<br> <br> But all hope isn’t lost, as Thaden quickly learns something unique about himself that might just allow him to survive long enough to escape the dungeon. Sure, all his new magical spells might be focused on healing and protection, but what does it mean when he seemingly won’t ever run out of Mana…?<br> <br> <i>This story contains an overpowered MC with a normally non-combat Class, LitRPG progression mechanics and stats, and isekai/portal fantasy elements. Contains no sexual content or harems.</i></p>";
