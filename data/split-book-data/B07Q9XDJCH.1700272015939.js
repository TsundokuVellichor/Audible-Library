window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first three books in the Immortal Series, in one box set!</p> <p>Book one: <i>Immortal</i></p> <p>Surviving sixty thousand years takes cunning and more than a little luck. But in the twenty-first century, Adam confronts new dangers - someone has found out what he is, a demon is after him, and he has run out of places to hide. Worst of all, he has had entirely too much to drink.</p> <p>Immortal is a first person confessional penned by a man who is immortal, but not invincible. In an artful blending of sci-fi, adventure, fantasy, and humor, Immortal introduces us to a world with vampires, demons, and other “magical” creatures, yet a world without actual magic.</p> <p>Book two:<i> Hellenic Immortal</i></p> <p>An oracle has predicted the sojourner’s end, which is a problem for Adam insofar as he has never encountered an oracular prediction that didn’t come true...and he is the sojourner. To survive, he’s going to have to figure out what a beautiful ex-government analyst, an eco-terrorist, a rogue FBI agent, and the world’s oldest religious cult all want with him, and fast.</p> <p>And all he wanted when he came to Vegas was to forget about a girl. And maybe have a drink or two.</p> <p>Book three: <i>Immortal at the Edge of the World</i></p> <p>In his very long life, Adam had encountered only one person who seemed to share his longevity: the mysterious red-haired woman. She appeared throughout history, usually from a distance, nearly always vanishing before he could speak to her.</p> <p>In his last encounter, she actually did vanish - into thin air, right in front of him. The question was how did she do it? To answer, Adam will have to complete a quest he gave up on a thousand years earlier, for an object that may no longer exist.</p> <p>If he can find it, he might be able to do what the red-haired woman did, and if he can do that, maybe he can find her again and ask her who she is...and why she seems to hate him.</p>";
