Now he's come face to face with the one entity few care to meet: Death. </p> <p>Someone has tried to kill Death - ripping the heart right out of him - or rather the body he's inhabiting. Death needs Sandman Slim's help: He believes anyone who can beat Lucifer and the old gods at their own game is the only one who can solve his murder. </p> <p>Stark follows a sordid trail deep into LA's subterranean world, from vampire-infested nightclubs to talent agencies specializing in mad ghosts, from Weimar Republic mystical societies to sleazy supernatural underground fight and sex clubs. Along the way he meets a mysterious girl - distinguished by a pair of graveyard eyes - as badass as Slim: She happens to be the only person who ever outwitted Death. But escaping her demise has had dire consequences for the rest of the world... and a few others. </p> <p>For years Slim has been fighting cosmic forces bent on destroying heaven, hell, and Earth. This time the battle is right here on the gritty streets of the City of Angels, where a very clever, very ballsy killer lies in wait. </p>";
