window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Physicist-turned-alchemist Edwin Maxlin partners with a powerful magical being to unlock his full potential in the second book of a humorous fantasy series. </b></p> <p>Since being transported from Earth to an unknown world, Edwin Maxlin has endured angry dwarves, wandering birdfolk, and marauding bandits—and it hasn’t even been a year. So when the opportunity presents itself for him to get off the grid and figure out how to actually use his Skills, he jumps at the chance.</p> <p>But life in the wilderness of Joriah isn’t as straightforward as it might appear. For one thing, surviving the Verdant will require Edwin to learn how to build his own shelter, acquire his own food, and avoid attacks from wild animals with unimaginable strength. For another, no matter how secluded he remains, the politics of the Lirasian Empire keep trying to suck him back in.</p> <p>As if all that weren’t enough to wrap his head around, Edwin suddenly finds himself the companion of an ancient and powerful fey who seems committed to helping him level up and follow his Paths, but whose motivations are unclear—and disconcerting.</p> <p>At once wryly humorous and wildly inventive, <i>The Way Ahead 2</i> is a perfect continuation of the series that blends fantasy, science, and role-playing games into one unforgettable journey.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than two million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible and wherever ebooks are sold!&nbsp;</b></p>";
