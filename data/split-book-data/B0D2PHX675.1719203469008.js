window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A slice-of-life progression fantasy all about friendship, family, and farming!</b></p> <p>Matt Miller wasn't special. He was just a regular guy with a regular lifeâ€”a one bedroom apartment, a couple of pairs of slacks, and a dead-end job. But when his estranged grandfather died, he left Matt with an unexpected inheritance: a magic ring and a farm located on another world.</p> <p>Now, Matt's stuck with a rundown farmhouse, fields choked with weeds, and no way to get back home. He only has one option, to roll up his sleeves and complete the quest prompt he's been given: Restore the Farm. Luckily, he has a (mostly) merry band of sprites to help him along the way. But this new land has secrets, and more than a few hidden dangers. The Harvest Goddess has been turned into stone, and the balance of magic is all out of whack. If Matt cant figure out a way to bring his grandfather's property back to life, then Corruption will continue to spread and consume the farm, the forest, and the sleepy town of Sagewood itself.</p> <p><b>Don't miss the start of this mostly cozy isekai Progression Fantasy Series. It's perfect fans of Beware of Chicken, Sacred Cat Island, and Oh, Great! I was Reincarnated as a Farmer, as well as games like games Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon.</b></p>";
