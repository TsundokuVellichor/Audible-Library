window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Phlox isn't your typical pixie, and his feisty shifter DNA might be the reason.</b></p> <p>Recruited by the Magical Usage Council, Phlox—who is now Agent Frost—is a pixie with a mission, and he's not afraid to place himself in mortal danger to eradicate the latest pixie trafficking ring.</p> <p>Despite being King Lucroy Moony's second-in-command, Leon McMillan's second life has become dangerously monotonous. For a vampire, boredom is as deadly as a stake to the heart. Three hundred years of existence has taken a mental toll—one that will eventually lead Leon into the sun's deadly embrace. Leon needs a life raft; he just never imagined it in the form of a pushy pixie.</p> <p>Phlox and Leon can't deny their mutual attraction. However, in order for Phlox's mission to succeed, he needs to appear helplessly alone, and Leon's worried stalking isn't aiding that mission.</p> <p>Soon, the knowledge Phlox and Leon obtain leads to a dangerous, mentally unstable djinn, who has a vicious master holding its leash. Although history claims djinns are all-powerful, indestructible creatures, Phlox and Leon must find the secret to their destruction if they are to save Rutherford Haven's citizens. If they can't, Rutherford Haven will be the first to fall, but it won't be the last.</p> <p>Phlox will dig his shifter claws into anyone who dares threaten his mate, and Leon will tear the heart out of anyone who dares threaten his beloved—his purrfectly peculiar pixie.</p> <p>Purrfectly Peculiar Pixie <i>is the fifth and final book in the Perfect Pixie series, which should be enjoyed in order.</i> Purrfectly Peculiar Pixie <i>features an emotionally constipated vampire, a pixie who's far more than he appears, witches and trolls with questionable morals, an alpha werewolf whose time on planet Earth is precariously close to its end, a (questionably) good djinn, an (unquestionably) sinister djinn, an interesting necromancer, and all our previously beloved characters coming together to prove that teamwork really does make the dream work.</i></p> <p>Purrfectly Peculiar Pixie <i>contains homicide of the fantasy kind (no humans were killed in the making of this book) with scenes describing death and killing.</i></p>";
