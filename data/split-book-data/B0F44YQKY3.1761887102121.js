The final boss is waiting.</b></p> <p>Now that Digby has gained control over all the powers of death and holiday cheer there’s only one thing left to do. Fight Henwick. He always knew it would come down to that, but knowing doesn’t make it any easier. Even with the magic of a demigod in his pocket, he’s spent enough time in Las Vegas to know that nothing is ever a sure thing. To make matters worse, he’s just been given a deadline.</p> <p>Fortunately, he already holds the key to stacking the deck in his favor. Unfortunately, that key is Parker, his one time honorary conscience turned enemy spy. Though her every move makes Digby tense up for what seems like an inevitable betrayal, he'll need to keep her close to pull off one last plan.</p> <p>He just needs to hold everything together long enough to play his final hand, or it'll all unravel at once. Digby's curse may have ended the world, but if he can find the courage within himself to face his fears… he just might be able to free it from Henwick’s grasp for good.</p> <p><b>Either way, the apocalypse is going to end.</b></p>";
