However, adventurers must work, and the Horns have been called on as security for an ambitious project: building a road past the Bloodfields towards the rest of southern Izril.</p> <p>There is more to the world than just Liscor, however. Players of Celum are coming to Invrisil with a splash. There are [Knights] from Terandria roaming around Izril after their battle with the Witch of Webs, and they have heard tell of a mysterious slayer of Goblins. Throw in Foliana, a Three-Color Stalker hopping about her day, and there are endless opportunities for chaos. But with fun and excitement always comes danger.</p> <p>The Bloodfields spread like a stain upon the land, and few who enter ever survive. The Horns of Hammerad don't plan on entering or getting into more trouble. However, even the monsters on the edges of the Bloodfields are a cut above the rest. Whether they triumph or perish to their rivals, cowardice, or foes...</p> <p>The Bloodfields await.</p>";
