window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Everything Arwin fought for was a lie. </b>The war was fake and the fault for its creation laid in the arms of the Adventurer’s Guild. But as powerful as Arwin has been becoming, he’s nowhere near strong enough to take the Guild on yet. And that’s just fine with him. He’s more than happy to live the life he’s always wanted, building up strength and making connections with allies new and old.</p> <p>For the first time in history, the Hero of Lian and the Demon Queen stand together. They may stand on uneasy ground, but their eternal fight is over. A host of other misfits join them. All of them are plagued by demons of their own pasts, but they’ve found a path to the future at each other’s sides.</p> <p>Things are peaceful.</p> <p>And then the Iron Hounds struck in cowardice, destroying Arwin’s smithy in an explosion that stole the life of an innocent child. They’d meant to silence an uppity crafter that had refused to obey their orders. Their message had been received — but not by the one they thought they were dealing with.</p> <p>The Iron Hounds managed to do what had never been done before. For the first time in history, the Hero of Lian and the Demon Queen will march to war on the same side. Their fury will be quenched by nothing less than the complete destruction of the guild that dared intrude upon their peace — and they will not stop until everyone responsible for Zeke’s death has followed him to the afterlife.</p> <p><b>Book 2 in the next epic LitRPG Saga from Actus, bestselling author of Return of the Runebound Professor. With nearly 7-million views on Royal Road, this definitive edition is perfect for fans of Seth Ring, Jonathan Brooks, Michael Chatfield and lovers of all things Progression Fantasy and Crafting.</b></p>";
