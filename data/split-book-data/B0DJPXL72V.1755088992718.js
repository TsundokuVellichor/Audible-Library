window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Max became a living weapon to save humanity from an alien threat—only to discover the fate of the entire universe rests in his hands—in this portal fantasy.</b></p> <p>Abducted by the Zoos Collective, Max Cromwell and his fellow unlucky humans were drafted to fight in the Cosmic Games. Fighting for survival on the hostile planet of Alpha Ludus against three extraterrestrial armies, the recruits from Earth have become super-soldiers by learning to cultivate mana. But Max's prowess surpassed that of both his teammates and his enemies as he not only developed extraordinary abilities but became Soulbound to the spirit of a sentient firearm named Maverick.</p> <p>Max's power hasn't gone unnoticed by members of the Intergalactic Consortium of Civilized Beings, the aliens overseeing the games. They need his help to control the weapon they created, one desperately needed to face a threat to the very fabric of reality across multiple dimensions: the Outsiders. These entities consume and assimilate civilizations and worlds, absorbing them into a single hivemind driven to corrupt all existence into an Anti-Life universe.</p> <p>The ICCB want Max to lead a strike force against the Outsiders. While preparing for war in brutal battle simulations and cultivating rituals, Max also attracts the attention of another mighty alien empire in conflict with the ICCB: the Jianari. The empire wishes to increase their galactic influence by allying themselves with Max . . . through a royal wedding.</p> <p>Max's accruement of spiritual energy has revealed his purpose as an avatar of destruction on the cusp of ascending to Celestial godhood. He's beginning to understand how powerful he is—and how he can change the rules of the Cosmic Games once and for all.</p> <p><b>The third volume of this LitRPG adventure series—with more than 600,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
