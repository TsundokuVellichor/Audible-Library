He gained a quest to help a war princess defeat an epic boss monster, and he's going to need the best adventurers around to build a raiding army and secure some sweet, sweet achievements.</p> <p>How does he do it? He puts a bounty on his own head for a \"catch me if you can\" style quest.</p> <p>As beginner adventurers, great and steady, hunt after Joey, the Shade Dragon Rogue and his friends race north to investigate a mysterious operation at a ruined temple containing clues involving devils and dungeons. This can further level up Joey's profile of shadow, necromancy, and dragon magic, on top of making him more of a menace as an overpowered battle rogue.</p> <p>Follow Joey in the continuation of an apocalypse isekai story with strong progression and LitRPG elements. He'll explore an ancient temple, face off against monster hordes, and fight an organization of haters. He'll search for lost dungeons and overcome devilish mysteries while being chased by thousands of adventurers.</p> <p>This may lead to Joey's evolution, where he'll gain more shady dragon magic and new skill upgrades. As long as he can survive crushing challenges that aren't meant to be faced solo.</p> <p>[Welcome back to Multiverse Z!]</p> <p>[Now let's continue the show.]</p>";
