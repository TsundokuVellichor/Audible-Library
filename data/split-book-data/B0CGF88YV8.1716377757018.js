window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Most Premier League fans are happy to cheer from the stands, but one fan—armed with some serious RPG talent—is taking his soccer pride onto the pitch.</b></p> <p>Not too long ago, Max Best was stuck in a dead-end job, trudging from one day to the next and mourning the fact that his burning love of soccer was getting buried in a landslide of cold statistics and intangible tactics. Then, after saving an old man from a mugging, he was \"cursed\" with the ability to instantly ascertain a soccer player's attributes on sight and use that knowledge to upgrade his own skills. Now he's making a name for himself as an amateur team manager, but it's not enough for him to ditch his dud of a job.</p> <p>Soon Max realizes there's only one logical next step to levelling up to his dream of being a top-tier manager: become a player himself. But first a great many things have to fall into place. From healing up his injured ankle to evaluating his real strengths as an athlete to continuing his scouting and dealing with his own client list, he's got a lot on his plate—to put it mildly.</p> <p>Turns out there's a massive difference between knowing how the game is played and actually playing it. If Max really wants his dream to come true, he'll have to put in the work&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 700,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
