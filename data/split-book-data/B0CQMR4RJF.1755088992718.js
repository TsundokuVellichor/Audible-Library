window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One uniquely gifted football fan goes from face-in-the-crowd to manager-to-remember as this electrifying LitRPG series for fans of </b><b><i>Ted Lasso</i></b><b> continues.</b></p> <p>When football fanatic and lovable loser Max Best saved an old codger from a mugging, he never expected to be rewarded with the ability to immediately pinpoint a player's specific skills—and use that knowledge to up his own levels. Ever since that fateful night, Max has devoted himself to the game far more than any mere fan, becoming not only a serious footballer in his own right but a leader both on and off the pitch.</p> <p>Then, just as he's about to accept a manager position at formerly bottom-of-the-league Telford, Max is offered the job of director of football at Chester FC, a role that may not even exist . . . yet. But in order to have a chance in hell of getting the gig, he's going to have to convince the team's fan representative board—one of whose members goes by the charming name \"Bulldog\"—that he's for real.</p> <p>To do that, Max will have to play attack <i>and</i> defence as he navigates the stark reality of the professional football industry and struggles to survive to play another day. Because while playing hard on the field can get you a win, playing hardball off the field can lose you everything.</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 800,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
