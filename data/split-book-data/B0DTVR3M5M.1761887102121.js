Panicked, the gods of Elatra hurriedly sent a message to all High-Level Combat Class users: \"Band together. Stop this threat. Or all will be lost.\"</p> <p>Rob and Riardin's Rangers have been put in the awkward position of needing to ally with the gods and the Dragon Queen in order to survive. It's an uneasy alliance that only grows more strained as time goes on. Mutual benefit is barely enough to keep them from turning on each other.</p> <p>It's still nothing compared to what they'll face in the Deadlands. Within the Blights' personal heaven, hell waits for everyone else.</p> <p>And after that... Well. The gods. The Blight. Dragon Queen Ragnavi. Riardin's Rangers.</p> <p>Forces are colliding. Only one faction will survive.</p>";
