window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The line between one cyborg's machinery and humanity grows perilously thin—and deadly—as this action-packed LitRPG adventure series continues.</b></p> <p>Not too long ago, the cyborg NSLICE-00P—Non-Standard Leashed-Intelligence Cybernetic Enforcer—was an unstoppable machine of war. But when a fateful murder caused her to be launched into a whole new reality, she slowly began to realize that she could be something more . . . if she wanted.</p> <p>Fighting alongside the Empire against the deranged Heralds of the New Dawn cult, NSLICE-00P is still one tough, extremely violent unit. But when she decides to save the life of a friend by embedding her with NSLICE tech, some very deep cracks appear. Why do these enhancements cause her friend such physical and mental pain? Can't she simply go on like NSLICE-00P's various cyborg/animal/insect experiments have? Is it because she's human—like NSLICE-00P used to be?</p> <p>Now, in addition to squaring off against the enemy, NSLICE-00P finds herself in a battle with her own programming, memories, and increasingly powerful and chaotic emotions, which run contrary to her very existence. She'll have to face the fact that she may be becoming something more human than machine. But since the machine parts are the only things keeping her alive in this perilous reality, does she really <i>want</i> to?</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than two million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
