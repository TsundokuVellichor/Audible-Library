If Auric’s not meant to be prey in this place, then why is he so tasty and bite-sized?</p> <p>Worse still, the Prophet didn’t just survive the journey to this new instance, he’s taken root and grown into a fearsome new form. Could he be behind the strange rot that’s consuming the world’s vast jungles? Or is it something even more sinister?</p> <p>And what about the bone towers? What secrets are hidden within their skeletal walls? If Auric’s going to find answers—and even hope to defeat the Prophet once and for all—he’ll have to make allies in a world without humans and master new powers in a place where the rules of the System are entirely changed.</p> <p>Auric Cain saved Earth, but that was the easy part.</p>";
