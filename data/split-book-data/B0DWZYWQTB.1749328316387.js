window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Twenty years ago, Jason was pulled into a world of magic and monsters.</b></p> <p>He was promised a life of wandering his new home and having adventures, but things got out of hand pretty quickly. He met with kings and gods, fought interdimensional cults, and got in a knife fight with the guy who creates universes. He didn't win. What he'd never done was roam around, having nice, sensible adventures. He hadn't even seen the hometown of his friends, and that had been the first destination on his list.</p> <p>Two decades on, he'd saved whole civilizations and the Earth, several times. He was freshly returned from a conflict with the fate of the cosmos at stake, where the battlefield was his soul and the combatants were the governing forces of reality. It was a fight he had no chance of winning, which was why he rigged it and pinched the prize while everyone was distracted.</p> <p>Now, Jason is determined to reunite with his friends and have the simple adventuring life he always wanted. He won't let anyone get in his way, not angelic armies, scheming guilds, or the people who want to talk about that time he altered the fundamental laws of magic. Which isn't as bad as it sounds, he promises.</p> <p>Jason's taking a gap year, whatever he has to do to make it happen. Manipulate a prestigious noble house into liberating a slave town. Attempt to extort every government on the planet. Blow up and subsequently rebuild the occasional city. Gods help anyone who tries to stop him, but the gods probably won't because they've met Jason and they know how that usually goes.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
