After destroying a few too many local dungeon cores, those cores within a certain radius are experiencing enhancements to their development. This means that they are not only dangerous to her core, as the instigator of these enhancements, but to the local population as well.</p> <p>However, with the help of the friends she has made along the way and her crafting skills, Sandra will learn how to defend her dungeon and help the surrounding lands survive the sudden increase in the number of dangerous Dungeon Monsters wandering around. None of this will come without a cost, unfortunately, be it the lives of many gnomes, dwarves, elves, and orcs - or her own sanity.</p> <p>Find out how the crafty dungeon core perseveres through the challenges arrayed against her and her dungeon in the final three books of the Dungeon Crafting series!</p> <p><b>Contains the last three books in the Dungeon Crafting series!</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Crafter’s Darkness</i></li> <li><i>The Crafter’s Dominion</i></li> <li><i>The Crafter’s Dynasty</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><b>These Dungeon Core stories contain LitRPG/GameLit elements such as statistics, leveling, and a heavy crafting emphasis.
