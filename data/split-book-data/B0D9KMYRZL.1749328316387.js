Trick steps. Even sneaky, slick steps. Whether you're on or off the pitch, you best know your footing. And for Max Best, that's no problem at all. He has the ability to read players to a T—thanks to the sentient stat-tracking display he received after saving an elderly man in the streets.</p> <p>Now, as director of football for Chester FC, everything's falling into place for Max. His team is climbing the ranks. He's executing great transfers and hired a literal old hand for his brand-new women's team. Plus, his no-holds-barred attitude and unorthodox way of working the league systems is making a serious impression. What could go wrong?</p> <p>Well . . . everything actually. First, a top-notch prospect gets snaked out from under him. Then, an old adversary starts playing dirty behind the scenes so Max can't play on the field. And his wheeling and dealing has landed him in the wrong kind of spotlight. But the worst part is that he's beginning to suspect the one behind all the chaos is the increasingly devilish old fellow he rescued so long ago . . .</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with more than 800,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
