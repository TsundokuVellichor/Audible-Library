Even if that ego is deserved, just a little?</p> <p>Chief is learning to be a little more supportive, except when Chief of Security Wulfson decides a few students deserve a little more intense training.</p> <p>With all of the additional injuries Kaiden suffers in his extra-curricular training, will he succumb to the blue goop pain killer?</p> <p><i>You don't become the best of the best by staying alive. With the Animus, you are closer to perfection with each death you suffer.</i></p> <p>For Kaiden Jericho, he'd rather skip the death part, thank-you-very-much.</p> <p><i>Includes special note from co-author Michael Anderle.</i></p>";
