Midgard came back with a sucker punch.</b><br> <br> Joe the Ritualist has finally found a true community in Vanaheim at the Tower of Ritualists. To his delight, he’s greeted by Masters of his craft, a Grandmaster on the brink of ascension, and a method to fix his most glaring flaws.<br> <br> Barely entering the tower before being sent away once more, Joe is given a quest by the soon-to-be Sage: leave Vanaheim for another world, learn to fight as a combat ritualist, improve his foundational skills, and return with a Mythic core no matter how long it takes.<br> <br> There's plenty for him to accomplish on Midgard. His guild, town, and Pathfinders Hall need an upgrade. Not to mention, there aren’t many places in Eternium he can go to win a fight using only Novice rituals. Too bad for him, Joe's enemies haven't been idle in his absence. They’ve just been biding their time. The Ritualist’s return triggers a retaliation years in the making, but they’ve made one major mistake....<br> <br> <b>He's already RSVPed, and Joe's not going to miss his mom’s big day—even if he needs to tap out and let the world burn.</b></p>";
