window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young swordsman must retrieve a magical blade—and learn the truth about his past—in this fantasy adventure set within the Arcane Ascension universe.</b></p> <p>A young man lives among the trees of a primeval forest, raised by a wizened old sage and friend to the faeries and spirits of his home. He bears only half a name—Lien, an ancient word meaning \"blade\" or \"edge\"—and no knowledge of his heritage. As he grows, so too does his need for independence and answers. Thus, he begins his adventure, seeking a shattered sword and the truth behind the mysterious mark on his right hand.</p> <p>To earn his freedom from his adoptive grandfather, Lien will seek to complete the trials of Anathema, a long-hidden weapon of devastating power. To succeed, he must master his own burgeoning power, learning swordplay and magic from fractured figments of ancient legends. Though his training will push him to the brink, failure comes at an even greater cost. For only with his talents fully forged will Lien stand a chance against his true foe: destiny itself.</p> <p>Set within <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author Andrew Rowe's Arcane Ascension universe, and inspired by Japanese manga and role-playing games, <i>Edge of the Woods</i> is the first volume of an epic new fantasy series perfect for fans of <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.</p>";
