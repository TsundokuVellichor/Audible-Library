window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>New places, new threats, new cards!</b></p> <p>Whisked away from Earth and dropped into a world filled with magic and wonder, Wildermount was the closest thing Gareth had to a home. Now it’s been destroyed, torn apart by twisted nightmares lashing out at the world around them.</p> <p>Fleeing to the arcane tower he discovered with friends and refugees alike in tow, Gareth finds himself involved in new peril. Something dark is corrupting the rainforest around the tower, and stopping it will involve traveling half the world away to a place unlike any he has come across yet. A land where the dead walk the streets as smokestacks blot out the sky.</p> <p>Gareth will need all the levels and experience points he can get if he’s going to survive in this new land. New enemies await him, and new cards lay waiting to be discovered, along with an ancient and powerful secret. One that might just give Gareth the edge he needs in his quest to topple the gods.</p>";
