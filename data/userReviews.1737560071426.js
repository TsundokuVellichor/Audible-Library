While the book has a strong emphasis on Catholicism—more than I initially expected—it doesn’t detract from the story at all.<br><br>The narration by SBT was outstanding, with excellent sound effects that really brought the story to life. I’m a huge fan of their work, and they didn’t disappoint.<br><br>Overall, I’m thrilled I picked up this book. It was so engaging that I finished it in just one day.

Also I immediately thought this was a crossover between Avatar the Last Airbender and Red Dead Redemption which caught my interest. <br> <br>There was a lot of monologues which I was not a huge fan of but overall the book was good. I definitely preferred the second half of the book and would read the next book in the series. <br> <br>The narration and music was excellent as I have come to expect from SBT. </p>","title":"More western than LitRPG…"},{"asin":"B0DCCH3RYV","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"5"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"5"},{"name":"Story","stars":"5"}],"summary":"<p> When I read the summary of the book, I was hooked immediately. I’ve also never read a Shami Stovall book before, but I love SBT’s narrations, so I was even more eager to try this book. <br> <br>This book was a fast-paced urban fantasy, a mix of Groundhog Day and crime mystery. It was an excellent, engaging listen and had some good twists. <br> <br>Can't wait for the next book! </p>","title":"Fantastic and amazing listen!"},{"asin":"B0DCGPGVQP","ratings":[{"name":"Overall","stars":"5"},{"name":"Performance","stars":"5"},{"name":"Story","stars":"5"}],"summary":"<p> I've never listened to a Macronomicon work before, but after this one, I'll be looking at their other books! The blend of action, humour, and the unique magic-system-tech setting kept me hooked from start to finish. There were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, and I can't wait for book 2. <br> <br>As always, SBT delivered a phenomenal performance—10/10, I’ll be listening to this one again! </p>","title":"Fun and unique take"}];
